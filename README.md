# A Rat's Life — Solo Tactics Field Manual
The Ultimate Guide to Stealth, Sabotage, and Solo Operations in Arma Reforger or any large-scale FPS of your choosing.
## FOREWORD

Welcome. If you're reading this, you're ready to learn the ways of the Rats — a brotherhood of players who master the art of lone wolf, commando-style sabotage in large-scale tactical shooters. If you enjoy playing squad-based games largely on your own for whatever reason, and enjoy sneaking around causing trouble, then this guide is for you. I will show you how to operate solo in large-scale shooters while still positively contributing to your team and the game state. In fact, applying these tactics well will make your solitary vermin-adventures worth more than a handful of hapless squaddies.

This guide assumes a basic level of competence with Arma Reforger and the mechanics of the game. If you are an absolute beginner then this guide will still help you, but I would recommend you check out the excellent guide by zarki34 here (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3402008832)

Solo players are underserved when it comes to guides in tactical shooters. While squad tactics dominate most guides, this handbook fills that crucial gap for those of us who prefer to chill on our own in games. Whether you're a dedicated Rat, a separated squad member, or simply looking to sharpen your solo skills, you'll find everything you need to make a decisive impact while operating alone in Arma Reforger and similar large-scale FPS games.

The tactics within this guide draw from declassified infantry manuals, which I have adapted specifically for the reality of gaming. For example: real-world doctrine tells soldiers to use SLLS: Stop, Look, Listen, Smell when patrolling. Since Arma Reforger lacks smellovision, I've streamlined this to SLL: Stop, Look, Listen. Throughout this guide, you'll find similar practical adjustments that bridge the gap between real-world doctrine and our virtual escapades.

You'll note that the infantry manuals you can find online are almost exclusively dedicated to squad operations. Even snipers work in teams. The challenges we face as solo operators in Reforger are rarely documented. So I've stripped down squad tactics to their solo essentials, borrowed concepts from other military disciplines, and pressure-tested everything in actual gameplay over two decades of being a sweaty Rat.

— toast

# 1. RAT DOCTRINE & MINDSET

## What is a 'Rat'?

**“Rat”**: the name captures the spirit of how we operate and how we are perceived. We call ourselves Rats because we are meant to be hated. We are vermin in the enemy's rear, chewing through their resources, ambushing their friends and vanishing before they can retaliate. When they do catch us, we reappear just as quickly as we were exterminated, ready to annoy again.

In Arma Reforger, “Ratting” is the art of operating deep behind enemy lines, fulfilling the role of a commando or saboteur. The Rat acts largely alone or in small cells, leveraging sabotage, ambushes, theft, and nuisance to destabilise and harass enemy forces. Their goal is not to seize territory by force of arms, but to erode enemy logistics, morale and operational coherence through persistent, unpredictable harassment.

Basically — be as annoying and destructive as you can without being seen and without dying.

We are the single operator who distracts large amounts of resources from the enemy into dealing with you rather than winning the game. Rats do not fight fair, ever. They lurk in the shadows, strike without warning and disappear before the enemy can comprehend what has happened.

Rats have received their namesake in part because their playstyle demands scavenging. They live off the battlefield, arming themselves with whatever they can recover from the dead, whether by their hand or someone else's.

Your enemies will curse you. They will call you cowards. At that moment when you hear their frustration spill out over Platoon chat on a radio you stole from one of their own, you will know you're doing your job right.

The term 'Rat' as we know it currently came from Escape from Tarkov (see seminal educational video — [https://youtu.be/o286LaBz__Y](https://youtu.be/o286LaBz__Y)), but the philosophy has since spread far beyond.

This is what Rats do.

Rats deploy themselves to the battlefield and engage in clandestine operations to disrupt the enemy, this includes:

- Disrupting enemy supplies by stealing, destroying or sabotaging enemy vehicles, ambushing supply lines, mining roads and wasting resources at enemy arsenals.

- Delay or destroy reinforcing enemy forces through ambushes and route denial.

- Disrupting enemy operations by ambushing or sabotaging high-value vehicles like helicopters and tanks.

- False flag operations using enemy uniforms for infiltration and ambush (but beware of XP penalties in Patch 1.3).

- Radio theft and psychological operations — stealing enemy radios to monitor communications and, where permitted by server rules, broadcasting on enemy frequencies to sow confusion and chaos (without being abusive).

- Locating and destroying enemy radio backpacks to eliminate their mobile spawn points.

- Force the enemy to overcommit resources like manpower, vehicles, and time to deal with an elusive, low cost vermin-like threat.

- Solo-cap objectives and while doing so, deconstruct base assets to frustrate enemy efforts and waste their supplies

- Solo-cap objectives and force the enemy to waste resources to deploy to the point to prevent the objective being lost.

- Entering enemy bases and using their arsenals to waste their supplies by buying items and dropping them in the vicinity nearby.

- Maintain continuous psychological pressure by frustrating the enemy team wherever possible.

- Any other mischief the Rat sees fit to employ, provided it is within the rules of the game and advances his team's ability to win the game.

## The Psychology of the Effective Rat

A Rat must reject the conventional battlefield ego of the average FPS player. This playstyle is not for those who seek glory, heroic last stands, or kill counts for their own sake.

The Rat embraces cowardice as virtue. Running without shame. Hiding without honour. Striking only when victory is certain. This mindset demands total suppression of the ego that drives most players to “prove themselves” in fair fights.

To Rat effectively, you must prioritise survival above all else. Each spawn costs precious supplies — whether through vehicles or radio backpacks. Death is failure, not sacrifice. The dead Rat disrupts nothing.

**The Rat thinks constantly.** Too many players spawn, kit up, jump in a vehicle, and drive blindly toward their objective only to be annihilated on the way. This is not Ratting; this is feeding. Every movement demands consideration: Which routes avoid likely ambush points? Where might enemy Rats be operating? What escape routes exist if contact is made? The thoughtless Rat is a dead Rat.

**The Rat maintains purpose.** Sneaking around an objective outside radio range serves no one. Hiding in a bush 2 km from anything of strategic value is not infiltration — it's desertion. Before every action, ask: “How does this help my team win?” If you cannot answer, you are not Ratting. Every position must threaten something the enemy values or enable something your team needs.

Rats do not fight fairly. They do not engage unless holding an overwhelming advantage. When surprised, they flee immediately. When cornered, they evade. There is no shame in retreat, only in unnecessary death.

Like their namesake, Rats survive through cunning, not courage. They scavenge, they hide, they strike from shadows. This is not a playstyle for those seeking respect or admiration. Your enemies will hate you. Your teammates may question you. But results will speak for themselves.

Your team may celebrate their successful push, but you'll know it was your ambush on that reinforcement truck that tipped the scales.
## Operational Philosophy: High Impact, Low Visibility

While psychology governs the Rat's mindset, operational philosophy guides their tactical decisions. The principle is simple: maximum disruption with minimum exposure.

This requires ruthless prioritisation. Random kills and aimless wandering wastes time and resources. Every action must advance strategic objectives that weaken the enemy's ability to win.

Effective target selection demands map awareness and predictive thinking. Consider likely supply routes, identify reinforcement patterns, and locate critical objectives. Flipping the right objective can cut off half the map from comms. An ambushed supply truck can starve a forward position and prevent the enemy respawning to defend. A well set ambush position can provide the buffer your team need to cap a point.

Consider: that enemy helipad might be a tempting target, but is it currently active? That sniper might be an easy kill, but are they actually affecting the battle? The disciplined Rat constantly evaluates:

- What target offers maximum disruption?
- Where is the enemy most vulnerable?
- How can one action cascade into multiple problems?

When priorities shift, the Rat adapts immediately. Clinging to outdated objectives is tactical malpractice, if you haven't seen any enemies in a while, then it's time to move. Thanks to radio backpacks, relocation is simple. When conditions change, pack up and redeploy without hesitation.

A single Rat, correctly positioned and properly focused, becomes a force multiplier.

**This is the way of the Rat.**


## How Patch 1.3 Changes the Ratting Meta

Patch 1.3 fundamentally altered disguise operations. Previously, Rats could wear enemy uniforms and engage targets without penalty and still grind XP. 

The new system tracks what you are wearing and which team you're dressed as. Kill while wearing enemy colours and you receive an increased friendly fire penalty. You will be demoted through the ranks, ultimately reaching _Renegade_ status. Renegades lose all arsenal access to **any** arsenal, friend, or foe. This is important because a Rat may rely on the enemy arsenal in bases they sneak into to resupply from, reducing them to pure scavengers. Some servers will also kick Renegade ranked players automatically.

Nametags have also been buffed in that they now appear when players are using binoculars, meaning it is much easier to spot someone in disguise than it used to be — this means the meta of hiding in plain sight is now basically dead.

**Disguises remain viable — but require new discipline:**

- Use for passive infiltration only.
- Avoid combat while disguised.
- If you are going to carry out ops in disguise, accept the XP loss.

These changes mean the era of Ratting in disguise is mostly out of the window and the new golden era of Ratting begins.

# 2. ARMA REFORGER BASICS
If you are a beginner to the game then I recommend looking to this excellent beginner's guide here - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3402008832. It is very thorough and covers almost everything you need to know.

That said - if that guide is too long for you and you are already familiar with the general gameplay of a mil-sim like game, this is a whistle stop tour of the mechanics of Arma Reforger and the battlefields you will be Ratting in.

**If your not new to the game - it is still worth reading the below, it is surprising how much I learned writing this!**
## Game Objectives

Look at your map and you will see objectives with black titling and objectives with purple titling.

Conflict mode operates on a simple premise: control purple-named bases to win. Period.

- **Purple Bases**: Your scoring objectives. Control 5-6 of these (number shown on map) to start the victory countdown.

- **Black Bases**: Radio network extenders. Can be used to build bases, FOBS, supply and re-arm the enemy . These don't count for victory but are critical because **you cannot capture a purple base unless it's connected to your team's radio network through these black bases**.

This creates a predictable flow to battles that you can exploit. Most players mindlessly rush purple objectives, but a Rat understands the network's vulnerability. Capturing or sabotaging a single black base can cut off multiple purple ones from the enemy network - forcing them to redirect massive resources to re-establish connection.

**If the base isn't connected to the network, it is useless and does not count to the score.**

This means one wise Rat can cut off a key objective in the game and stop the enemy team from winning the game, giving your team time to reinforce and push a comeback. This happens more than you'd think.

## The Supply Web

Supplies dictate everything in Reforger:

- Each base has a shared supply pool which ticks up slowly every 5 seconds or can be manually resupplied with supply trucks.
- Resources regenerate only when a radio relay is present.
- Resources determine how quickly and how many enemies can respawn, equipment availability, and vehicle access.
- Supply trucks feed the system, making them high-value targets for Rats.

When you ambush a supply truck, you aren't just killing one driver - you're potentially starving an entire forward base and preventing the enemy defending or attacking an objective. So ambushing supply trucks is a key way to disrupt the flow of the enemy game.

That said sadly not many players hop on to play logi much, and so while ambushing supplies is a high value task, more often than not nobody is doing it at all.

A truly devious Rat will infiltrate enemy bases, use their arsenal to purchase expensive equipment, then drop it in the vicinity - bleeding their supply pool dry, radio backpacks are good for this as they are usually the most expensive item in the arsenal.

## Network Infrastructure

The radio network is how the team communicates and if you are not in signal range of your teams radios you won't be able to hear them or communicate with them. Wise Rats don't need to speak to their friends, they know what they need to do by looking at the game state, you will likely spend more time listening to the enemy channels than your own.

Your radio can be configured to change frequencies but both teams run on their own 'network' so to speak, so you will need the radio of that faction in order to listen in. USA operates on 48 MHz and Russia uses 42 MHz.

For a Rat, communications intelligence is crucial. Steal an enemy radio, and you can monitor their transmissions. Remember that when you speak on your radio, you're also audible in proximity chat - keep transmissions brief when behind enemy lines.

Radio relays in bases extend network coverage. Without coverage, a base cannot be captured. Each relay creates a 2000m radius of control and connects to other relays to form the network.

This creates your primary strategic target: destroy a relay, and you sever that base from the network. The enemy cannot spawn there, and if it's a critical junction, you've potentially isolated multiple objectives.

You can only destroy base buildings by deconstructing them, you can only deconstruct them if you are capturing the base...

### Base Capturing

As of 1.3, when you begin to capture a base the enemy cannot spawn there and must spawn at the nearest other objective and travel to defend the base. As a solo operator the fact you are able to capture the base usually means there is no one around, within the cap zone anyway of about 50m.

If you are capping the base you can use your spade to dismantle things the enemy have built within 50m of their HQ tent which is the tent with the nations flag on it, this means you can destroy radio relays preventing the enemy from spawning even if you die and cutting off the network at that node. You can also destroy their defences, buildings and other things they have spent time and resources building.

Be careful as players are now wise to this, so the meta is to put the relay outside of the 50m of the headquarters tent, so you can't destroy it on your own and will need someone else to cap the point while you destroy the relay.

A further word of caution is that if you destroy everything and capture the point then your team has to rebuild everything themselves to make the point operational again, bear that in mind and have a think about how likely it is that the enemy will flip the point again before going scorched-earth on everything.
## Base Building

After capturing a base, you can construct buildings. Know their purpose and priority because inversely you can use this to destroy things in enemy bases when you can:

1. **Radio Relay**: Primary target - disables respawns and network connection.
2. **Heavy Vehicle Depot**: Allows truck spawns, holds 3400 resources.
3. **Light Vehicle Depot**: Enables jeep spawns.
4. **Gas Station**: Increases spawn fuel from 25% to 75%.
5. **Living Quarters**: Reduces respawn costs, allows AI defenders.
6. **Arsenal**: Provides weapon access, moderate supply storage.
7. **Hospital**: Medical functions, high storage capacity.
8. **Helipad**: Enables helicopters, requires higher rank.

## Combat System

Arma Reforger is a hardcore mil-sim style shooter meaning:

- Weapons come pre-zeroed based on doctrine (440m Russian, 300m US).
- One well-placed shot can kill instantly.
- Default equipment is actually quite effective - don't waste resources on fancy kit. RPGs then silencers are your staple go to equipment takes.
- Stance affects accuracy, silhouette, and mobility.
- Weapon parts (suppressors, scopes) can be swapped in field by holding interact.
- Enemies that go down are often unconscious and injured, meaning you have to make sure they are dead.
- You can loot items from enemy or friendly bodies and use them on your own equipment i.e. you can take a fallen ally's silencer even if you don't have the rank to get one at the arsenal.

Russian and American weapons have different zeroing philosophies. Press increase range button once for 100m/200m zeroing - better for close combat and most engagements. I personally zero everything to 200m, this is reliably across both factions weaponry then.

## Health System

Arma Reforger has a health system, each limb can bleed, be broken or injured. You get the following things to help with that:

1. Bandages to stop bleeding.
2. Tourniquet to quickly stop bleeding, these can be taken off and replaced with a bandage. These are painful to your character so can affect mobility and accuracy.
3. Morphine to accelerate healing and revive unconscious allies. Use of morphine will heal limbs and the associated accuracy / movement costs.
4. Saline to replace blood loss though this is rarely utilised in the current meta.

Rats should stock up on medical supplies, you spawn with two bandages and one morphine you should seek to get as much of them as you can to last extended deployments. In my time playing the game tourniquet's are not much use, and you can forgo these. 
## Vehicle Mechanics

Understanding the use of vehicles will help your Ratting escapades:

- All vehicles require resources to spawn - destroying them costs the enemy resources.
- Vehicles come with wrench and gas can in cargo, most vehicles have a trunk and this may contain medical supplies or other items of use.
- Each vehicle has specific vulnerabilities (to be detailed in Vehicle Tactics section in a later update).
- You can use your knife on the end of your rifle as a bayonet to pop the tyres on most vehicles, though some require 2 - 3 hits.

When operating deep in enemy territory, never park your escape vehicle near your target. Hide it at least 200m away in dense cover.
## Rank System

Your rank affects the items you can pickup from an arsenal and your ability to command the AI. For Rats you won't need to command the AI but you will need to use enemy and friendly arsenals, rank affects your use of both.

- Private: Starting rank, basic access
- Corporal: Improved equipment options
- Sergeant: Access to advanced vehicles, limited AI command
- Lieutenant: Full helicopter and AI command capabilities

Ranks reset each match. Gain XP through capturing bases, building structures, destroying enemy assets, and combat.

**Remember** - Killing the enemy in their own uniform reduces your rank in 1.3 and ultimately can demote you below private to **renegade** where you no longer have access to any arsenal friend or foe. Some servers will kick players of renegade rank.

## Communication

Communication in Arma Reforger is local proximity chat and radio chat, bear in mind if you are talking on your radio you can be heard in proximity chat, like in real life.

- Proximity Voice: Anyone nearby can hear you
- Team Radio (48 MHz US/42 MHz Russia): Reaches all teammates, even across map
- Squad Radio: Limited to your squad members

For the solo Rat, the most valuable communication asset is a stolen enemy radio. This lets you monitor their movements and, if you're feeling particularly devious, transmit false information on their channels.

## Mobile Spawn Points

Two critical tools for the persistent Rat:

1. **Deployed Radio**: Each squad can deploy one field radio providing 10 spawns. Essential for maintaining presence in contested areas. A solo Rat can use a radio to remain an annoyance in any particular area.
2. **Mobile Command Units**: Special trucks that function as faction-wide respawn points and extend radio coverage. Eliminating these should be a priority target when encountered.

## The Rat's Edge

Reforger's systems aren't designed for solo players, but they're perfectly exploitable by them. While squads focus on front-line objectives, you target the infrastructure supporting them:

- Destroy radio relays to isolate bases
- Ambush supply / reinforcement routes to starve resources
- Capture undefended network nodes to sever connections
- Remove resources through arsenal waste
- Monitor enemy communications for intelligence

One Rat who understands these systems can disrupt enemy operations far beyond their number.

# 3. FIELDCRAFT
> “If the enemy can see you, and you are within range of his weapon system, he can engage and possibly kill you. So, you must be concealed from enemy observation and have cover from enemy fire. When the terrain does not provide natural cover and concealment, you must prepare your cover and use natural and man-made materials to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and your position.”
> 
> The Warrior Ethos & Combat Skills

The use of concealment and cover is an essential infantryman technique that has kept soldiers alive for hundreds of years. Rats, as solo operators out in the field, literally live and die by their aptitude to identify and stick to proper cover and concealment.

## 1. Utilising Cover and Concealment

Cover protects you from enemy fire. Concealment hides you from enemy observation. Neither guarantees both.

Natural cover includes terrain features like rocks, hills, and trees. Man-made cover includes trenches, sandbags, and vehicles. When the terrain offers neither, camouflage becomes your only option — match your uniform and equipment to the environment.

Concealment in Arma Reforger consists mainly of bushes, grass, and shadows. 

**There's a catch:** grass and shadows render at player-defined distances for performance reasons. While you're lying “concealed” in tall grass, enemies with low graphics settings see you sprawled in open ground. This affects most tactical shooters, not just Reforger.

***Assume all grass is invisible — it is useless to you as concealment!***

Some games force shadow rendering, but grass remains optional. You can't rely on vegetation for concealment. When in doubt, use hard cover or terrain depressions instead.

### Silhouette and Skylining

Silhouetting / Skylining occurs when a Rat’s outline is visible against a contrasting background, making detection likely even at a distance. Moving across open ground without cover creates a distinct shape the enemy can easily spot. Skylining is a specific form of silhouetting that happens when a Rat moves along the crest of a hill or ridge. Against the lighter sky, the body forms a clear, dark outline, presenting a perfect target.

To avoid this, Rats must move below the tops of hills and ridgelines whenever possible, staying against broken backgrounds such as vegetation or uneven terrain. Pausing on high ground must be avoided; even brief exposure can betray a Rat’s position. Darkness offers no protection — figures against the night sky remain easily visible.

A Rat who fails to control their silhouette will be seen. A Rat who is seen will be killed.

### Camera View, Posture, Concealment, and Cover

Arma Reforger's multiplayer servers can be set up to either only allow first-person gameplay or to support both first- and third-person perspectives. Always check the view setting that is being used when you join a server. You can do this by pressing the mapped change perspective key or button. If the view switches from first to third person, you are on a third-person server; if you are unable to switch back to the third-person view, you are on a first person server. What you can do in concealment and cover will be affected largely by the view modes available to you.

Some players prefer to use first-person view exclusively. Others will take full advantage of third-person mode and play in a hybrid of 1pp and 3pp (1st / 3rd Person Perspective). The most significant advantage of third-person view is **third-person peeking**, that is the ability to see over or around cover without exposing your body. This provides a clear field of vision while denying the enemy the opportunity to engage. In terms of tactical leverage, this is considerable.

Rats do not fight fair. If the server allows third-person view, you are expected to use the third-person peek. Every player on the server has access to the same tools and, especially on consoles, the vast majority of players will be doing the same thing. Choosing not to use third-person peeking when it is available is a self-imposed handicap.

**Posture Controls** are a critical component of concealment and visual discipline. In Arma Reforger, you can adjust your character’s stance incrementally using the Control key and scroll wheel. Each base stance, standing, crouching and prone can be fine-tuned through several sublevels, like this:

```
STANDING    ┌─ Level 5 (tallest)
            ├─ Level 4
            ├─ Level 3
            ├─ Level 2
            └─ Level 1 (lowest) ← Best for 3PP peeking

CROUCHING   ┌─ Level 5 (tallest)
            ├─ Level 4
            ├─ Level 3
            ├─ Level 2
            └─ Level 1 (lowest)

PRONE       (Single height only)
```

**The Golden Rule: Go as low as possible while keeping the camera advantage.**

Simply — you should configure your character to be as low as possible while still maintaining the camera height benefits of the stance 'mode' you are currently in. The **standing stance** provides the highest third-person camera elevation, offering the broadest field of view. However, this also exposes the largest silhouette and target for the enemy. By adjusting your posture to the **lowest possible setting within the standing stance**, you retain the high camera perspective while significantly reducing your visible profile. This allows you to observe your surroundings from cover with reduced risk of exposure.

The crouched, and prone postures offer reduced height and improved concealment, but with corresponding decreases in mobility and camera elevation. In third-person view, the camera lowers as your posture changes from standing to crouched to prone, reducing your observational advantage.

When moving, remember **that your character keeps its height setting when you stop — unless you switch between standing/crouching/prone, which resets it to default.** That means if you are in a low crouch when you sprint crouch from cover to cover, when you stop, your character model will resume at the 'level' you were at before you moved.
### Hiding in Bushes

Bush concealment is fundamental in Arma and a trick as old as time. As a Rat you will depend on hiding within bushes on a very regular basis to go unseen. Often, hiding in a bush concealment in plain view of the enemy is safer than hiding behind cover in terms of not being detected. Both Russian and American uniforms blend well with Reforger's foliage, especially the US disruptive patterns.

Two factors determine success: positioning and camera control. This technique works on both server types but excels in third-person for the obvious reasons.

**Basic Technique:**

1. Enter bush and crouch — provides the best balance of concealment and visibility.
2. Lower your stance further with Ctrl + scroll wheel.
3. Aim weapon downward to tuck your profile into foliage.
4. Double-tap Left Ctrl for weapon low-ready (reduces barrel exposure).
5. Hold Alt for free look (observe without moving).
6. Double-tap Alt to lock free look for extended observation.

**Third-Person Advantages:** Crouching in 3PP keeps your camera elevated above foliage while your body stays hidden. In 1PP, you only see what your character sees, so you have to give up concealment for the sake of visibility.

**First-Person Considerations:**

- Position deep enough that foliage obscures your upper body and partially obscures your view, that way you know your chest / weapon are not sticking obviously out of the brush.
- Accept some visual obstruction — clear view means you're exposed, branches and leaves should be in your way.
- Be more mindful of your weapon barrel and where it is sticking out, adopting the low ready position can help.

**Tactical Trade-offs:** If lowering your weapon to improve concealment just bear in mind it leads to a reactionary gap. In low-risk areas, prioritise concealment. In high-risk zones, keep weapon ready despite the larger profile.

**Key Warnings:**
1. Prone positioning often exposes legs beyond the bush edge, particularly to flanking enemies hence why crouching is almost universally better.
2. Your weapon barrel can betray your position even when your body is well-concealed. 
3. Remember that bushes provide no protection from incoming fire — they hide you, they don't shield you. 
4. Your concealment needs will vary depending on your mission: total invisibility for reconnaissance may require accepting heavy visual obstruction, while ambush positions demand a balance between concealment and clear firing lines.

Hiding in bushes will allow you to hide in plain sight, often, the enemy will not see you until they are literally standing on top of you. I have had players walk over me in foliage and still not know I am there (somehow).
### Actions as Concealment

Rats can do a lot to help their stealth capability by being wary and mindful of their actions and how they might give them away. Light discipline means not using your torch, turning off headlights on your vehicles and so on.

Most gaming monitors have a gamma or night vision capability, and this is how the majority of players can see at night.

Rats don't fight fair, neither does anyone else, if you have it, you should use it.

**Noise** — Any form of movement makes noise, in the current state of the game you *speed* dictates how loud you are, the slower you are, the quieter you are. **Your posture / stance does not affect how loud you are currently!** Bear that in mind.

Vegetation and terrain features such as bushes, undergrowth, and branches aggravate movement noise, with snapping twigs or rustling foliage revealing a Rat’s approach long before they are seen. 

If you are operating near enemies, you need to mask your sounds, or you will be compromised and you will die. Time your movement with other in-game sounds to help mask the sound of you moving. Move when the enemy is moving, firing, talking on their radio, or the wind is blowing through the trees and foliage.

**Radio Comms** — Talking in prox. chat is obviously going to give you away, but bear in mind that when you **talk on your team / squad radio, your character will also talk in prox. chat** as you would expect to happen in real life.

**Totally silent faction / squad chat** is achievable by using the text chat function on PC, to get messages to your team with your character model remaining completely silent. Just make sure you're not typing into global chat!

**Movement discipline** — Do not move without having a reason to move and a plan of where you are going and what you will do if you are suddenly compromised. Motion invites observation and creates noise, the human eye is naturally attracted to movement and gamers finely tuned to the sound of footsteps. If you have to move, continue using cover and concealment, crossing open ground must be avoided unless you have literally no other choice. If you *must* walk across open ground, time it well, move as quickly as you can and try to use 'dead ground', which is an area of terrain where natural dips folds or obstacles obscure enemy sight of you.
### Why Rats Get Seen

Despite following the principles of cover and concealment Rats are often still seen and exterminated in the wild. This is because Rats misunderstand concealment. Staying hidden relies on you applying the principles we have covered in this section in combination with understand **how your enemy will see you.**

**Visual detection** is the primary threat to solo operators. The enemy does not need to see your entire body or gear, they only need to spot one small thing that does not belong. A shape that breaks a natural pattern, a shadow where none should fall, a flick of movement in the stillness.

Some things to consider:

**The human brain is an expert in pattern recognition**. It knows what to expect on maps like Everon. Empty buildings. Abandoned vehicles. Deserted roads. When everything should be lifeless, any sign of movement or presence triggers immediate attention. This is why a helmet edge in a window draws your eye from hundreds of meters away. It violates the expected pattern. Choose positions that match the context of the environment you are in.

**Movement is your greatest enemy.** The human eye glosses over static shapes but locks onto motion instantly. You can remain invisible at 50 meters until you shift position, then get spotted at 300. Even turning your head creates detectable change against a still background. This creates the Rat's dilemma: movement is necessary for mission success but deadly for concealment. Time your movements, plan your escape vector, movement discipline is key to your success.

**Shadows conceal, but they also betray.** You can third-person peak from behind the corner of a house all you want. Just remember, if the sun is in the right position, your long shadow on the ground is giving you away and the enemy is looking to flank you. Be wary of the changing light conditions and how they affect your concealment.
### Fighting Positions / Hides / Ratholes

A hide is a static position from which the Rat will observe from, engage from if necessary, and fall back to to survive. A hide is a deliberate spot selected by you in your area of operations, and the use of such pre-determined hides can be a key element to remaining undetected or surviving if compromised.

When selecting a hide, even a temporary one you only intend to use for a few moments or minutes — you must briefly consider the following factors.

**Selection Standards** — The ideal hide provides a clear field of fire while wherever possible denying the enemy a clean shot back. A second floor window overlooking a crossroads allows engagement while the walls offer protection, for example. A hillside position looking down into an exposed piece of road is an ideal hide and position to set up an ambush.

**Escape Planning** — You need to know how you are going to escape your position if you are pushed by the enemy, remember, Rats are cowards and do not go down in blazes of glory if they can help it. Do not allow yourself to be cornered. When picking a hide you need to briefly think 'What am I going to do and where am I going to go, if this position is compromised?'

A good hide has two avenues of escape dependent on the direction you need to go, you should have identified these routes when entering the hide for the firs time.


# 4. MOVEMENT
Movement is survival, but careless movement is suicide. Every journey across the battlefield demands careful consideration of terrain, timing, and threat level.

Watch any typical player, and you'll see them sprint straight from spawn to objective, only to catch a round in the head as they cross the final open field. Ten minutes of running ended in two seconds of poor decision-making. This is what happens when players move without thinking.

Smart movement follows a simple framework: plan your route as a series of waypoints, not a straight line. At each waypoint, execute the SLL protocol — Stop, Look, Listen. Take 10–30 seconds to scan your surroundings and listen for movement before continuing. This brief pause creates the reactionary gap that keeps you alive when contact happens.

Once you start putting this into practice you will be able to count up the number of times that SLL has allowed you to notice the enemy, get ready for them and win any engagement. You will find that plenty of players do indeed run aimlessly and pretty much in a straight line to where they are going a lot of the time, it makes them easy to pick off. Simply stopping to listen and observe, even if most of the time you have no cause for concern and continue onwards, will save your life countless times.

Route selection matters more than speed. Choose paths through low ground, vegetation, and broken terrain. Hills and ridgelines might offer great views, but they also silhouette you against the sky — making you visible to every sniper or player within a kilometre. That open field might save you two minutes of walking, but is two minutes worth respawning and starting over? When your conducting Rat operations that take you 10+ minutes just to infil to where you need to be, the answer is obviously no.

Your movement should match the tactical situation:

If Enemy Contact Is: **NOT LIKELY**
Move By: *Walking / Running / Driving*

If Enemy Contact Is: **POSSIBLE**  
Move By: *Walking / Running, with frequent Stop / Look / Listen pauses*
Note: If driving, a legitimate strategy is to just barrel through as fast as you can and hope for the best, it will work more than you think.

If Enemy Contact Is: **EXPECTED**
**DO NOT DRIVE!**
Move By: *Walking only, maximum Stop / Look / Listen discipline*. 

Movement without purpose gets you killed. Take the extra minute to move smart. The player who rushes blindly into contact rarely survives long enough to learn from their mistakes.
### Moving From Cover

Once you've been firing from a position, assume the enemy knows your location and are waiting for your head to pop up again. This is when most players die — trying to re-engage from a compromised position. 

Never stand up where you went down. Instead, crouch or roll several metres to either side before coming up. The enemy's crosshairs are on your last position. Make them adjust. That split-second of confusion might save your life and cost them theirs.

When you must cross open ground, use what soldiers call the “3-5 second rush". Most players need 2–3 seconds to acquire a moving target, adjust their aim, and fire accurately. By limiting your exposure to 5 seconds maximum, you stay inside their reaction window.

Pick your next cover point before you move. When you break from cover, sprint full speed for 3–5 seconds, then hit the dirt. Don't stop because the timer says so — stop when you reach cover.

The key is unpredictability. Never establish a pattern. Sometimes rush for 3 seconds, sometimes 5. Sometimes roll right, sometimes left. Keep them guessing.

**Remember — Rats survive by being where the enemy doesn't expect them. Every time you move, ask yourself - ”Where would they expect me to go?" Then go somewhere else.
## URBAN MOVEMENT

Arma Reforger features small urban environments where specialised combat principles apply. Success as a Rat in these zones demands unique skills. You'll need proficiency in urban movement, building entry techniques, room clearing, and selecting tactical positions.

For the Rat, CQC in urban areas is viable but risky. CQC tactics is covered in section 6 below. The odds nearly always favour defenders. Every "hide" you create must have escape routes that you've genuinely considered beforehand. Without proper planning, you'll get flustered when pushed. A squad storming your position quickly transforms your hideout into a coffin.

There are some tips to bear in mind when transiting through or engaging in operations in urban areas, which if you bear in mind will likely save your life on multiple occasions.

### Avoid Open Areas

Open areas such as streets, alleys, and parks should be avoided. They are natural kill zones for enemy shooters and snipers. Consider that every window facing where you are could have someone behind it, and you will see why open urban environments are so dangerous. Cross these spaces only when necessary, using smoke grenades if you know someone has a bead on you and / or the 3-5 second rush technique for protection.

The optimal path through urban environments is via rear gardens and property backsides. These routes offer plentiful cover and significantly reduce enemy visibility. Whenever possible, navigate behind buildings rather than between them. Stay off the streets.

### Move Parallel to Buildings

You may not always be able to use the rear or insides of buildings as routes of advance and may be forced onto the outside of buildings in the street. If so should move parallel to the side of the building along the building line. Stay in the shadows if you can, present as low a silhouette as you can and move rapidly to your next position.

### Moving Past Windows

Windows present an obvious hazard and the most common mistakes are exposing the head and chest in a first floor window to the enemy. Where possible stay below the window level and near the side of the building while ensuring you do not silhouette yourself in the window, you can easily do this by crouching and this way even when sprinting you are usually below the window line.

### Moving Around Corners

Corners are natural choke points and ambush zones. Entering them carelessly is fatal. The most common mistake a Rat can make is exposing their weapon barrel or full silhouette around a corner without first clearing it. If an enemy is waiting with their weapon trained, even a brief exposure results in death.

Do not approach a corner too closely. In most modern FPS, getting too tight to the wall will cause your character to raise their weapon into a non-ready position. Though it will snap back into place when you step out, the reaction delay can cost you your life. Always maintain a slight offset from the wall so your weapon remains ready.

Wherever possible, you should 'pie' the corner. Pieing is a deliberate clearing method where you slice the angle gradually in controlled steps, like slicing a pie. Instead of swinging wide and out of the corner exposing yourself, you move in wide arc, exposing only a narrow segment of the new area at a time. This method gives you a shifting field of view while keeping your profile small. Done correctly, pieing the corner allows you to clear unknown threats without over-committing. Your weapons remains in the ready position and your movements are controlled.

However, if you already know the enemy's position because you've seen movement, heard a reload or spotted something that gives the enemy away, then you should not pie. **You should pre-fire the corner.**

![Corner Clearing Technique](attachments/CornerClearingTechnique.png)

### Pre-Firing A Corner

In the next section of this guide, we will discuss how violence of action wins the majority of engagements in CQC encounters. Pre-firing a corner or angle is a prime example of this in action.

Pre-firing is simply beginning to fire your weapon as you strafe out of cover at the location the enemy is at. As you expose yourself you are already opening fire on the enemy. It goes without saying that fully automatic lends itself to this technique.

This is a solid technique in competitive FPS's where pre-firing combined with the reaction delay between the enemy seeing you and pulling the trigger further combined with server / client latency means if done correctly the enemy is dead as soon as you come into view and to them they inexplicably die the moment you appear. 

If you know an enemy is waiting for you then pre-firing on entry is a good way of turning the odds against the waiting defender.

### Clearing T Shaped Corners

T-shaped corners are among the most hazardous terrain features inside and out of a building. You cannot see left or right until you expose yourself — and an enemy could be lying in wait on either side, already aimed in.

If you know there is an opportunity to simply avoid this and move to a point where you will not be at such a disadvantage, then you should do so.

Most players commit blindly to one side and die for it. The smarter Rat slices both arcs gradually, exposing just a sliver of each sector in turn, as shown below:
![T-Junction Clearing Technique](attachments/TJunctionClearingTechnique.png)

This method lets you clear both corners incrementally before fully committing. It won’t make you bulletproof, but it massively reduces the chances of walking into a static ambush.

Once you've reached the decision point and must step into the junction, **do not hug the wall**. Defenders will almost always hold the closest edge. Instead, cut a **wide arc** away from the wall, forcing the enemy to adjust their aim and giving you a reactionary gap. That split second can decide who wins the fight.

### Entering a Building

Conventional infantry doctrine advises against entering buildings through doors or windows whenever possible, preferring to create new entry points with demolitions, breaching charges, or tank rounds. Arma Reforger does not simulate this kind of structural destruction, and you are limited to climbing through appropriately sized windows or using the door.

That means, more often than not, you’ll be using doors and that’s a problem, because that’s where defenders will be waiting.

**If a window is available and accessible, you should always use it instead.** Most players expect door entries. The element of surprise from entering via a window, even with the noise of the glass breaking, gives you a critical reaction gap. That gap is often enough to kill whoever is covering the obvious angle.

**Your character model will fit through any window pane wide enough to fit you. A lot of windows are two paned with a split down the middle, you will NOT fit through these so do not try.**

If circumstances allow, **precede your entry with a grenade**. The explosion will force defenders into cover or out of their sights, disorient them, or outright kill them. Either way, the Rat must enter **immediately** after detonation. Any delay forfeits the advantage and gets you shot walking into the kill zone.

Do not linger at the threshold. Move, clear, and kill. This is not the time to hesitate. It is when you are in the close confines of your enemy that you then enter close quarters combat...

# 5. CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT (CQC)
CQC represents the most volatile, unforgiving and lethal form of engagement available to the Rat, or any soldier for that matter. CQC is not restricted to buildings. A surprise contact in dense vegetation becomes CQC, someone popping up from cover to shoot at you 5 metres away is CQC. Any engagement where reaction time shrinks to milliseconds qualifies as close quarters combat. The principles below apply whenever combat distance collapses, regardless of terrain.

In real-world doctrine, CQC is universally recognised as high-risk. In Arma Reforger, it becomes exponentially more dangerous due to client/server latency and occasionally de-sync.

It is for these reasons that the Rat lives by the adage of only engaging when they know they are at an overwhelming advantage. Consciously entering CQC should only be done deliberately if you know, _beyond all doubt_, that you are in a position of such strong advantage the enemy has almost no chance to survive.

You attack by surprise, you attack with overwhelming force. It is in these moments when the Rat is faced with entering CQC, either because they choose to unleash it on the enemy or because it is unleashed on them, that the Rat must abandon hesitation and commit to the doctrine of **overwhelming violence of action**.
### Violence of Action

Violence of action is key to winning almost any engagement. While stealth, evasion, and deception are the default tools of survival and getting you *to* the fight, there comes a moment when the Rat must have the fight itself. When that moment arrives, it must be executed ideally on your terms but in any case with **overwhelming force, speed, and decisiveness.** 

**Violence of action** is the sudden application of surprise, aggression, and dominance to seize the initiative and eliminate the enemy before they can react. It is not optional. It is not negotiable. **Hesitation equals death in CQC engagements.**

In Close Quarters Combat, victory usually belongs to whoever strikes first with decisive force. The terms “attacker” and “defender” become meaningless — only initiative matters. A defender caught by surprise dies just as quickly as an attacker walking into an ambush. Position means nothing if you don't see it coming.

CQC is usually won at the moment of first contact. The player who achieves tactical surprise — who gets “the drop” — almost always wins. This advantage can shift in milliseconds. A camping player loses all defensive benefits the moment an enemy appears from an unexpected angle. An aggressive rusher becomes the victim when walking into a pre-aimed weapon. Yet paradoxically the defender holding an angle becomes the victim when the attacker moves faster than they can keep up with and causes them to miss their initial shot.

The OODA loop — Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — governs every combat engagement. Break down how you deal with an engagement in close quarters, play it in your mind in slow motion, you will note that you and your enemy are spinning the OODA loop constantly. In CQC, both players race through this cycle in fractions of a second, but the one who completes it first gains the advantage. More critically, the player who disrupts their enemy's OODA loop while completing their own wins the fight.

Violence of action weaponises this principle. When you strike with speed and aggression, you force the enemy to restart their OODA loop. They observe your attack, must reorient to your unexpected aggression and speed, struggle to decide under pressure, and act too late. By the time they complete their cycle, you're already into your second or third loop — adjusting fire, moving to better position, or finishing the kill.

Have you ever been rushed when holding an angle in a building, missed all your shots as the attacker bore down on you and killed you while you struggled to even readjust your aim? That is violence of action in play.

This is why hesitation kills in CQC. Every pause extends your OODA loop. Every moment of indecision gives the enemy time to complete theirs. The Rat who acts decisively — even if imperfectly — forces the enemy into a reactive state they cannot escape.

When CQC is initiated, whether by choice or circumstance, commit fully. Half-measures guarantee failure. Full automatic fire, aggressive movement, and overwhelming force create the chaos needed to survive. You must act faster than the enemy can process, creating sensory overload through multiple inputs — muzzle flash, incoming rounds and rapid movement that breaks their cognitive cycle.

**Initiative is everything.** The moment you cede initiative — through hesitation, poor positioning, or predictable movement — you become the victim. Seize it. Keep it. Use it.
## Urban CQC

Solo player or not, perfect technique or not, Urban CQC is a toss up between who wins and dies. You can execute movements perfectly and still die, this is the nature of urban CQC. 

As a result, for the solo operator especially - **Urban CQC should not be voluntarily engaged in, unless you can be sure you are at an overwhelming advantage.** Given that this is almost never the case, the best advice for your survival is to avoid Urban CQC entirely.

Yes, run away.

Take the random chance of urban CQC out of play by simply falling back, and keeping overwatch of the house you know an enemy is in instead, kill them when they come out to look around. Run out of your urban hide and take an escape route instead of staying to defend it. 

### The Solo Rats Disadvantage

Military doctrine almost universally approaches CQC as a team exercise. Standard infantry doctrine trains soldiers to clear rooms, enter buildings and use various different types of grenades as part of a coordinated team. For the solo Rat, these tactics are simply suicidal.

What military doctrine understands is that CQC favours the defender. Even elite level military units consider room clearing to be among the most dangerous operations possible. When military units conduct dynamic entries, they rely on overwhelming force, multiple simultaneous entry points and perfect coordination to overcome the defender's advantage.

There's a reason you see them simply blow the entire building sky high than enter it.

As a solo operator, you possess none of the advantages a team would have clearing a building, you cannot split angles of fire, provide covering fire for yourself, attack from multiple directions or create sufficient enough violence of action.

### When To Enter an Occupied Building Solo

Never.

There are no scenarios where a solo Rat should voluntarily enter an occupied building, military doctrine supports this position. In warfare isolated structures with known hostiles are typically contained, the enemy waited out inside, or the entire building is destroyed.

You should never enter a building you **know** contains hostiles.

If you suspect a building contains hostiles, assume it does.

If you are already in a building and detect an enemy, extract immediately.

### What If I'm Defending a Building?

Get out.

The instinct to defend your position is a trap, defending a fixed position without support, which will always be the case if you are Ratting, is a last resort. 

You will almost always die.

When you choose to stay and defend you go against the principles of Rat doctrine, namely:

- You become predictable.
- You limit your escape options.
- You allow the enemy to set the terms of engagement.
- You become vulnerable to grenades and squad entries.
- If they don't enter, they'll just wait for you to leave then kill you.

This is why you get out as soon as you can. A dear Rat isn't annoying anyone. Live to be a nuisance elsewhere.

### You're Doing It Anyway?

Alright then.

If you are going to engage in urban CQC despite the best of advice from Mr.Ratmeister himself, then fair enough. Despite its obvious disadvantages in terms of longevity of your character, it is fun and exhilarating to roll the dice in CQC.

There are of course, even putting best practices into place, going to be various scenarios when despite best efforts you are forced into urban CQC. Examples include:

- A sniper is decimating your team and holed up in a building you are approaching.
- You have entered what you believe to be an empty building only to hear an enemy, your committed now and must deal with the situation.
- You're trying to escape and for whatever reason (usually because you are injured and need to heal or you will die) you are cornered in a building and now are forced to defend it.
- There's an enemy radio backpack within a building you need to sort out.

It would be negligent of me as master Rat then not to show you the best practices on how to survive.

Even military doctrine recognises that urban combat sometimes becomes unavoidable. What applies to conventional forces also applies to you as a lone Rat. The difference is that military units train extensively for these scenarios and operate with team support - luxuries you don't have.

If you must engage in CQC, remember these principles:

- Intelligence gathering comes first - listen for movement and figure out to the best of your ability where in the building they are.
- Plan your entry and exit before committing.
- When possible, use grenades.
- Always pre-fire corners rather than just peeking if there is a chance the enemy is there.
- Move decisively - hesitation equals death.
- Accept that even perfect execution involves significant risk of extermination.

The techniques in the following sections aren't making CQC safe - they're just making it slightly less suicidal. 
### How to Clear Doors

Hallways and doors suck. Every doorway is a potential choke point, a bottleneck where defenders enjoy the greatest advantage. This zone is known as the **fatal funnel**, a narrow area in and immediately beyond the doorway where all incoming movement is focused and where defenders will distinctively aim. You want to be out of the fatal funnel if you can avoid it, depending on the layout of the building and the door itself.

**Pre-firing doors** - Bullets penetrate doors and if you know or believe an enemy is or could be behind the door then you absolutely should be pre-firing the door by blasting through it at angles where you think a defender may be hiding. This gives you the element of surprise and there is every chance you kill the defender or force them to have to bandage themselves, giving you the drop.

The Rat must consider every doorway as a know hazard. After pre-firing the door they now have to open it - the picture below advises on the best practice of opening the door:
![Door Clearing Technique](attachments/DoorClearingTechnique.png)
Much like real life Arma Reforger allows you to open the door side on as shown in the image, depending on the type of door and the hallway the Rat should immediately step back from the door to give space for them to go on to pie the angles in the room (slicing small sections of the room into view methodically). Ideally when pieing the angles into the room you should be as far away from the door as is possible while still maintaining visual contact within so as to reduce your silhouette to the defender. **Do not crouch while doing this, defenders will likely be aiming for your centre mass and crouching lowers your face directly into the sight picture.**

### Slicing the Pie

Once the door is opened, you slice the pie by clearing the interior of the room in small segments without entering. The ideal scenario is that the Rat is able to clear the room without entering the fatal funnel or being forced to breach into the room itself. The Rat moves incrementally along the outer arc of the doorway, slowly revealing more of the room slice by slice, as shown below:

![Door Fatal Funnel](attachments/DoorFatalFunnel.png)

Each lateral movement reveals a new “slice” of the interior, allowing you to scan corners and engage targets before they see you. This technique gives the you a fighting chance at spotting an enemy who may be holding an angle but hasn't yet seen your approach.

This method is safest when used from a distance not right up against the doorframe. Being too close limits your arc of vision and increases the likelihood of weapon clipping or poor corner geometry revealing your position. Maintain at least one body’s width back from the threshold to keep your weapon in a ready state and ensure maximum field of view.

If the room is shallow, with poor angles or limited cover, and you can confirm it’s clear through slicing do not enter. There is no tactical value in occupying a cleared space that offers no concealment, no advantage, and puts you at risk.

However, if your pie reveals nothing and corners remain unclear, because of doors that open inward for example, or you visually confirm a threat you have been unable to engage you must either:
1. Pre-fire and breach using overwhelming violence of action.
2. Withdraw and reassess your approach.

Never, ever 'creep' the final corner, never lean slowly into an uncleared space. Never do any of this slowly or at a pace where a waiting defender can easily adjust their aim to take you out.

You are either clearing or you are breaching. Hesitation will get you killed.

Slicing the pie is your first port of call to clear a room, use it to avoid having to engage in CQC if possible, but once the door is open, you are on the clock. Every second you spend standing in the funnel increases your already exceedingly high risk of death.
### Room Entry

Most tactical literature assumes that more than one person is clearing rooms. With two or more Rats, angles can be split, sectors controlled and breaches covered. The Rat however more often than not will be on their own. This means every room entry is a gamble as you expose your body to a potential ambush with no backup to cover your flanks. Breaching a room solo is the most dangerous action you can take in CQC and it should only happen after slicing the pie has revealed a significant portion of the interior.

Room entry begins where slicing ends; when you've cleared every slice of the pie you can from the outside and you now need to breach to clear any remaining blind spots. This is usually the space behind the door, deep corners or anywhere line of sight was occluded dependent on the layout of the room.

The doorway itself, the fatal funnel as we mentioned above, is the killzone where **you** die. It is where the defenders are most likely aiming. The longer you are there the higher your chance of death, once you commit to a room breach, you must move immediately, quickly and decisively.

![Door Entry](attachments/DoorEntry.png)

As the image shows, the Rat selects an entry vector that aggressively slices away from the most likely threat position. This usually means entering at an oblique angle sweeping wide away from the doorframe while aiming into the uncleared corner. Doors that open into the room you are clearing may have enemies hiding behind them. If you've sliced the rest of the room this is usually the final blind spot and it is where you must go first.

Once inside, pivot rapidly to cover the angles as you move. Do not stop inside the room unless it is clear, motion is a potent defence in these situations. Hesitation and delay gives a waiting defender time to correct their aim.

Once a room is clear, get out and do the next one.
### Hallways

A hallway is simply a very large fatal funnel. Never stand in the middle of it, as this exposes you to fire from multiple angles. Cling to the walls where the doors are located to minimize your silhouette and exposure.

When moving through hallways, be conscious of every doorway and opening that could conceal an enemy. Each door you pass represents a potential ambush point, and each meter of hallway traveled increases your risk of detection.

Military CQB training emphasizes proper hallway movement techniques for a reason - they're among the most dangerous environments in urban combat. If forced to move through a hallway:

1. Clear each section of hallway before advancing.
2. Keep your back to the wall you're following.
3. Minimize time spent in intersections and T-junctions.

### Clearing Stairs

Stairs also suck, a lot. Stairs, much like the rest of CQC movement are incredibly dangerous places for the Rat to find themselves if a defender is possibly within the building and potentially defending the staircase. They are vertical funnels with zero cover, limited movement options and any movement up or down them is incredibly predictable.

![Stair Clear](attachments/StairClear.png)

In squad doctrine staircases are handled with mini bounding overwatch movements and splitting angles. For the solo Rat however none of that exists. You either creep up slowly as most players do and get blasted the second your helmet enters the frame, or you rush.

The correct approach is to pie the base of the stairs first, for any persons stood on the first landing if there is one and then **rush**. Violence of action on defended stairs is a necessity and is your only chance out of your already slim chances of survival, I reiterate that if at all possible you should avoid having to clear an occupied building.

You rush stairs because defenders are likely holding an angle that will have your head their sights when you approach, the defender is relying on your slowly creeping up so they can shoot the Rat in the face. Do the opposite instead and rush them.

By rushing them you disrupt their sight picture, break their OODA loop and will force them to adjust their aim as you barrel towards them. It is during this reactionary gap that you kill or be killed.

### Conclusion

Once you have cleared a building, especially if you have had contact inside, you need to get out. The moment you fire shots in there, even if you kill the enemy, their buddies know where you are and are seeking vengeance. You need to loot quickly, exit immediately and ideally through a different exit to where you entered.

# 7. RAT TACTICS

While fieldcraft, movement and the principles of CQC will help you fight and stay alive, the bread and butter of Ratting is the tactical decision-making you employ. The correct use of tactics as a solo operator is crucial if you hope to survive any engagement with any enemy, especially when outnumbered which the Rat is bound to be.

### Trigger Discipline

The vast majority of players will shoot the moment they see a target. Rats do not.

Trigger discipline is the conscious decision to delay an engagement until conditions overwhelmingly favour you. It's the difference between reaction and control, between a hasty death and tactical victory.

Your first opportunity to fire is rarely your best one. You might have only a partial sight picture. The target could be outside effective range. Your weapon sway might be too heavy after sprinting. Their movement might be erratic. And critically - you might not yet know if they're alone.

Firing your weapon sets in motion a chain of events from which there is no return. A single shot alerts the area. A second confirms your position. Within 60 seconds, enemies will either be returning fire or closing ground to flank you. Rats don't engage unless they're in a position of advantage.

Before pulling the trigger, ask yourself:

- Can I drop this target cleanly with my first volley?
- Is my exfiltration route already planned?
- Will this engagement serve a broader tactical purpose?
- Do I have overwhelming advantage in this situation?

If the answer to any of these is no, hold fire. It's better to let an enemy walk past than to start a fight you cannot finish. Remember: you're not here to collect kills - you're here to survive and disrupt. Dead Rats accomplish neither.
### Dead Time Exploitation

Most kills in Arma Reforger happen during direct engagements, 1 v 1. However, Rats do not seek fair fights. Ratting doctrine prioritises attacking from a position of overwhelming advantage. One of the most reliable ways to achieve that advantage is to exploit what is known as dead time.

Dead time is any moment when an enemy’s awareness is reduced when they are standing still, focused on a task, or otherwise distracted. Common examples include:

- Checking the map after spawning or getting into a vehicle, or any time spent checking the map.
- Looting or purchasing gear at the arsenal or from bodies.
- Reloading.
- Sitting idle in a vehicle waiting for passengers.
- Holding defensive positions inside buildings or behind cover (camping).
- Stopping to spawn a vehicle or build things in the base.
- Healing with morphine or bandages.

The most predictable of these behaviours is looting gear from bodies or purchasing from an arsenal.

Dead time provides the opportunity to fire at a completely stationary, preoccupied target. A single well-placed shot in this moment is more effective than three fired at a moving or alert target. The delay in the enemy’s reaction also extends your survivability affording you precious seconds to relocate or prepare follow-up shots before they identify your position. If the shot is placed correctly, the engagement ends before the enemy can react. If the shot fails, the responsibility lies with entirely with the Rat.

You will begin to recognise that dead time forms behavioural patterns. Players spawn, then move to the arsenal. They spawn vehicles, then sit to check the map. After battles, they return to loot gear.

Your job as a Rat is to observe these rhythms and exploit them. You must time your engagement so that you strike when the enemy is least capable of responding and disappear before they recover. 

### Body Baiting

Body baiting is the deliberate use of casualties or wounded players to lure others into a compromised position. It is a psychological and tactical trap that is a strand of predictive ambush. 

Rats may initiate this tactic in one of two ways: by injuring or killing a target while already holding overwatch on the position, or by moving into overwatch after noticing a casualty in an ideal position. In either case, the objective remains the same - force the enemy to expose themselves.

Players in FPS games that allow looting struggle to resist the impulse to retrieve loot or assist injured teammates. Most will move toward a fallen comrade or enemy body without first assessing the situation and as a result put themselves into a position of huge vulnerability. Once a player begins looting, they are immobile and all it takes is a well placed shot to prevent any sort of direct confrontation in the first place.

Body baiting punishes greed, loyalty and carelessness in equal measure. Use it when terrain and concealment favour your position and when there is a high likelihood of multiple contacts entering the kill zone.
### Ambush

An ambush is a surprise attack delivered from concealment or cover. For the Rat, it is not a platoon-level fire plan but a solo strike: sharp, brutal, and brief, over almost as soon as it begins.

Because Rats operate alone, every ambush demands some foresight and discipline. Before firing a single round, the Rat must select a kill zone, choose a concealed vantage point with clear sight of that zone and a pre-planned escape route, and mentally rehearse the sequence: engage, disengage, vanish. 

The ambush has the following objectives:

**Eliminate.** The primary objective is a clean kill that removes enemy combat power and denies them the chance to react.

**Strand.** If elimination fails, the secondary goal is to disable or immobilise the enemy. Force them to dismount, walk, or burn a respawn ticket. Time lost to recovery or to have to stay and heal, delaying their onward mission, is a tactical victory.

**Frustrate.** If neither kill nor stranding is possible, the tertiary objective is to annoy. A single wounding shot or forced delay burdens the enemy with caution and slows their mission as they spend time searching for you.

Before committing to an ambush, the Rat must assess whether the action will influence the match as a whole. A perfect firing position is useless if the only targets are isolated players. Conversely, an ambush laid on a key reinforcement route or an exit of a key base can decisively alter momentum in the team's favour.

Always ask: _Will this make a difference?_ If the answer is no, find another mission.

Planning an ambush requires two critical elements: a kill zone and a vantage point. The kill zone is the area through which the enemy must pass and where fire will be concentrated. An ideal kill zone is long enough to allow for multiple shots, follow-up fire, reloading, or weapon switching if necessary. Narrow kill zones demanding a single perfect shot are unacceptable.

Contingencies must be considered. A wounded driver may stop; a dead driver may crash the vehicle. The vantage point must allow continued engagement during such events without exposing the Rat to return fire. 

If the kill zone or vantage point is suboptimal, the ambush must be abandoned. No Rat should gamble their life unless the odds are overwhelmingly in their favour. Proper ambush sites create conditions where enemy survival is unlikely and pursuit is impossible.

Trigger discipline is incredibly important when ambushing. If ammunition is limited, conserve it. If you have just one RPG then maybe the jeep with one player in isn't the best target, wait for the BTR, the supply truck, or the jeep full of troops to target.

Engage only when the primary target is inside the designated kill zone. Temptation to fire early must be resisted, the kill zone is where your advantaged and so firing outside that will prompt the enemy to flee and never entry your kill zone to begin with. Waiting until the enemy enters the kill zone maximises your tactical advantage and improves the likelihood of a clean kill.

Maintain fire until the enemy is neutralised, stranded, or suppressed. The litmus test for disengagement is simple: if the enemy begins returning effective fire towards your position, you must withdraw. The moment rounds strike near your cover, the ambush has served its purpose. Remaining in place only increases the chance of being overrun.

Unless the engagement has reduced to a clear one-on-one or a severely disadvantaged enemy position, break contact immediately. Move to secondary cover and begin evasion. Continued engagement is justified only if the enemy remains stranded, confused, and unaware of your new location.

A Rat who plans, strikes, and escapes with precision eliminates resources, drains time, and frustrates the enemy team's efforts to win the game.
### False Retreat

A natural extension of the ambush, and a key tactic in the Rat’s arsenal, is the false retreat. Rats will find themselves using this technique in almost every operation they undertake.

The false retreat mirrors elements of conventional infantry contact-break drills, but the term is better suited to the solo operator. Where conventional forces withdraw under pressure, the Rat withdraws deliberately — baiting the enemy into yet another engagement where the Rat holds the advantage.

In a false retreat, the Rat falls back from their original vantage point after firing, then establishes a secondary position with clear oversight of the site just abandoned. Understanding the impulsive nature of players in FPS environments — where wounded or angered enemies will rush forward seeking revenge — the Rat turns enemy aggression into a trap. As the enemy pushes into the original kill zone, the Rat, now concealed in a new overwatch position, engages them once again from surprise.

The false retreat grants the Rat a second opportunity to eliminate targets who survived the initial strike. Pursuers are often disorganised, wounded, or overconfident — all advantages to the Rat lying in wait.

When conducting a false retreat, the fallback position must offer concealment, overwatch of your recent vantage point which now becomes your new kill zone, and impose fresh disadvantages upon the enemy. The same principles apply as in the original ambush. If the enemy gains sight of your fallback position and begins delivering sustained, accurate fire, you must immediately disengage. A Rat does not hold ground against superior firepower.

False retreats will often be dynamic and fluid. Often the second position will not be as strong as the first. If your new position is weak, maintain overwatch at distance. Be patient. Many enemies will eventually return to the scene of the original ambush to retrieve wounded comrades, to recover supplies, or simply to resume their mission. When they do, the Rat repeats the ambush process. Strike again. Kill again. It is also an option to do nothing and wait for them to leave, believing you have either given up or died, before setting up your original ambush on the next party coming through.

### Shoot and Scoot

As stated in the foreword, most published infantry doctrine focuses on team-based tactics. When you're part of a fire team or squad, you have access to a wide array of techniques involving suppression, bounding overwatch, and coordinated manoeuvre. Solo operators do not have that luxury. And if real-world doctrine exists for lone soldiers acting as Rats, it isn’t publicly available.

So we adapt.

**Shoot and scoot** is a concept borrowed from artillery doctrine: fire, displace, do not wait to assess results. For artillery, this prevents counter-battery fire. For the Rat, it prevents death.

This is not an ambush. There is no intent to hold ground, confirm kills, or re-engage from the same position. You fire — ideally at an exposed target — then immediately relocate. Whether you kill, wound, or miss entirely is secondary. The goal is disruption.

This tactic is ideal in several scenarios. First, when you do not hold a strong positional advantage and cannot risk taking return fire. Firing from a poor position and staying there is suicide. Firing and moving forces the enemy to respond while you are already gone.

Second, it is especially effective when the intent is not elimination but confusion. Surprise fire from an unexpected direction forces squads to halt, reorganise, or retreat. Even one well-timed shot can derail their momentum and focus attention away from the objective.

Third, shoot and scoot is one of the most viable solo tactics against armoured vehicles. A lone Rat cannot face armour in a stand-up fight. Even with an RPG, engaging once from cover may reveal your position. Scooting to a new angle and firing again keeps the vehicle off-balance, unsure of where the next shot will come from. Never engage armour from the same position twice.

Use shoot and scoot to apply pressure while remaining survivable. Fire, displace, reset. The enemy will be watching your last known position while you’re already preparing the next shot. That delay is your advantage. Maintain initiative. Control the tempo. Stay mobile, and stay alive.
