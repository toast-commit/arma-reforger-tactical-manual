[h1]1. RAT DOCTRINE & MINDSET[/h1]


[h2]What is a 'Rat'?[/h2]

[b]“Rat”[/b]: the name captures the spirit of how we operate and how we are perceived. We call ourselves Rats because we are meant to be hated. We are vermin in the enemy's rear, chewing through their resources, ambushing their friends and vanishing before they can retaliate. When they do catch us, we reappear just as quickly as we were exterminated, ready to annoy again.

In Arma Reforger, “Ratting” is the art of operating deep behind enemy lines, fulfilling the role of a commando or saboteur. The Rat acts largely alone or in small cells, leveraging sabotage, ambushes, theft, and nuisance to destabilise and harass enemy forces. Their goal is not to seize territory by force of arms, but to erode enemy logistics, morale and operational coherence through persistent, unpredictable harassment.

Basically — be as annoying and destructive as you can without being seen and without dying.

We are the single operator who distracts large amounts of resources from the enemy into dealing with you rather than winning the game. Rats do not fight fair, ever. They lurk in the shadows, strike without warning and disappear before the enemy can comprehend what has happened.

Rats have received their namesake in part because their playstyle demands scavenging. They live off the battlefield, arming themselves with whatever they can recover from the dead, whether by their hand or someone else's.

Your enemies will curse you. They will call you cowards. At that moment when you hear their frustration spill out over Platoon chat on a radio you stole from one of their own, you will know you're doing your job right.

The term 'Rat' as we know it currently came from Escape from Tarkov (see seminal educational video — [url=https://youtu.be/o286LaBz[/b]Y]https://youtu.be/o286LaBz[b]Y[/url]), but the philosophy has since spread far beyond.

This is what Rats do.

Rats deploy themselves to the battlefield and engage in clandestine operations to disrupt the enemy, this includes:

[list]
[*]Disrupting enemy supplies by stealing, destroying or sabotaging enemy vehicles, ambushing supply lines, mining roads and wasting resources at enemy arsenals.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Delay or destroy reinforcing enemy forces through ambushes and route denial.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Disrupting enemy operations by ambushing or sabotaging high-value vehicles like helicopters and tanks.
[/list]

[list]
[*]False flag operations using enemy uniforms for infiltration and ambush (but beware of XP penalties in Patch 1.3).
[/list]

[list]
[*]Radio theft and psychological operations — stealing enemy radios to monitor communications and, where permitted by server rules, broadcasting on enemy frequencies to sow confusion and chaos (without being abusive).
[/list]

[list]
[*]Locating and destroying enemy radio backpacks to eliminate their mobile spawn points.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Force the enemy to overcommit resources like manpower, vehicles, and time to deal with an elusive, low cost vermin-like threat.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Solo-cap objectives and while doing so, deconstruct base assets to frustrate enemy efforts and waste their supplies
[/list]

[list]
[*]Solo-cap objectives and force the enemy to waste resources to deploy to the point to prevent the objective being lost.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Entering enemy bases and using their arsenals to waste their supplies by buying items and dropping them in the vicinity nearby.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Maintain continuous psychological pressure by frustrating the enemy team wherever possible.
[/list]

[list]
[*]Any other mischief the Rat sees fit to employ, provided it is within the rules of the game and advances his team's ability to win the game.
[/list]

[h2]The Psychology of the Effective Rat[/h2]

A Rat must reject the conventional battlefield ego of the average FPS player. This playstyle is not for those who seek glory, heroic last stands, or kill counts for their own sake.

The Rat embraces cowardice as virtue. Running without shame. Hiding without honour. Striking only when victory is certain. This mindset demands total suppression of the ego that drives most players to “prove themselves” in fair fights.

To Rat effectively, you must prioritise survival above all else. Each spawn costs precious supplies — whether through vehicles or radio backpacks. Death is failure, not sacrifice. The dead Rat disrupts nothing.

[b]The Rat thinks constantly.[/b] Too many players spawn, kit up, jump in a vehicle, and drive blindly toward their objective only to be annihilated on the way. This is not Ratting; this is feeding. Every movement demands consideration: Which routes avoid likely ambush points? Where might enemy Rats be operating? What escape routes exist if contact is made? The thoughtless Rat is a dead Rat.

[b]The Rat maintains purpose.[/b] Sneaking around an objective outside radio range serves no one. Hiding in a bush 2 km from anything of strategic value is not infiltration — it's desertion. Before every action, ask: “How does this help my team win?” If you cannot answer, you are not Ratting. Every position must threaten something the enemy values or enable something your team needs.

Rats do not fight fairly. They do not engage unless holding an overwhelming advantage. When surprised, they flee immediately. When cornered, they evade. There is no shame in retreat, only in unnecessary death.

Like their namesake, Rats survive through cunning, not courage. They scavenge, they hide, they strike from shadows. This is not a playstyle for those seeking respect or admiration. Your enemies will hate you. Your teammates may question you. But results will speak for themselves.

Your team may celebrate their successful push, but you'll know it was your ambush on that reinforcement truck that tipped the scales.
[h2]Operational Philosophy: High Impact, Low Visibility[/h2]

While psychology governs the Rat's mindset, operational philosophy guides their tactical decisions. The principle is simple: maximum disruption with minimum exposure.

This requires ruthless prioritisation. Random kills and aimless wandering wastes time and resources. Every action must advance strategic objectives that weaken the enemy's ability to win.

Effective target selection demands map awareness and predictive thinking. Consider likely supply routes, identify reinforcement patterns, and locate critical objectives. Flipping the right objective can cut off half the map from comms. An ambushed supply truck can starve a forward position and prevent the enemy respawning to defend. A well set ambush position can provide the buffer your team need to cap a point.

Consider: that enemy helipad might be a tempting target, but is it currently active? That sniper might be an easy kill, but are they actually affecting the battle? The disciplined Rat constantly evaluates:

[list]
[*]What target offers maximum disruption?
[*]Where is the enemy most vulnerable?
[*]How can one action cascade into multiple problems?
[/list]

When priorities shift, the Rat adapts immediately. Clinging to outdated objectives is tactical malpractice, if you haven't seen any enemies in a while, then it's time to move. Thanks to radio backpacks, relocation is simple. When conditions change, pack up and redeploy without hesitation.

A single Rat, correctly positioned and properly focused, becomes a force multiplier.

[b]This is the way of the Rat.[/b]


[h2]How Patch 1.3 Changes the Ratting Meta[/h2]

Patch 1.3 fundamentally altered disguise operations. Previously, Rats could wear enemy uniforms and engage targets without penalty and still grind XP. 

The new system tracks what you are wearing and which team you're dressed as. Kill while wearing enemy colours and you receive an increased friendly fire penalty. You will be demoted through the ranks, ultimately reaching [i]Renegade[/i] status. Renegades lose all arsenal access to [b]any[/b] arsenal, friend, or foe. This is important because a Rat may rely on the enemy arsenal in bases they sneak into to resupply from, reducing them to pure scavengers. Some servers will also kick Renegade ranked players automatically.

Nametags have also been buffed in that they now appear when players are using binoculars, meaning it is much easier to spot someone in disguise than it used to be — this means the meta of hiding in plain sight is now basically dead.

[b]Disguises remain viable — but require new discipline:[/b]

[list]
[*]Use for passive infiltration only.
[*]Avoid combat while disguised.
[*]If you are going to carry out ops in disguise, accept the XP loss.
[/list]

These changes mean the era of Ratting in disguise is mostly out of the window and the new golden era of Ratting begins.
