[h1]2. ARMA REFORGER BASICS[/h1]

If you are a beginner to the game then I recommend looking to this excellent beginner's guide here - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3402008832. It is very thorough and covers almost everything you need to know.

That said - if that guide is too long for you and you are already familiar with the general gameplay of a mil-sim like game, this is a whistle stop tour of the mechanics of Arma Reforger and the battlefields you will be Ratting in.

[b]If your not new to the game - it is still worth reading the below, it is surprising how much I learned writing this![/b]
[h2]Game Objectives[/h2]

Look at your map and you will see objectives with black titling and objectives with purple titling.

Conflict mode operates on a simple premise: control purple-named bases to win. Period.

[list]
[*][b]Purple Bases[/b]: Your scoring objectives. Control 5-6 of these (number shown on map) to start the victory countdown.
[/list]

[list]
[*][b]Black Bases[/b]: Radio network extenders. Can be used to build bases, FOBS, supply and re-arm the enemy . These don't count for victory but are critical because [b]you cannot capture a purple base unless it's connected to your team's radio network through these black bases[/b].
[/list]

This creates a predictable flow to battles that you can exploit. Most players mindlessly rush purple objectives, but a Rat understands the network's vulnerability. Capturing or sabotaging a single black base can cut off multiple purple ones from the enemy network - forcing them to redirect massive resources to re-establish connection.

[b]If the base isn't connected to the network, it is useless and does not count to the score.[/b]

This means one wise Rat can cut off a key objective in the game and stop the enemy team from winning the game, giving your team time to reinforce and push a comeback. This happens more than you'd think.

[h2]The Supply Web[/h2]

Supplies dictate everything in Reforger:

[list]
[*]Each base has a shared supply pool which ticks up slowly every 5 seconds or can be manually resupplied with supply trucks.
[*]Resources regenerate only when a radio relay is present.
[*]Resources determine how quickly and how many enemies can respawn, equipment availability, and vehicle access.
[*]Supply trucks feed the system, making them high-value targets for Rats.
[/list]

When you ambush a supply truck, you aren't just killing one driver - you're potentially starving an entire forward base and preventing the enemy defending or attacking an objective. So ambushing supply trucks is a key way to disrupt the flow of the enemy game.

That said sadly not many players hop on to play logi much, and so while ambushing supplies is a high value task, more often than not nobody is doing it at all.

A truly devious Rat will infiltrate enemy bases, use their arsenal to purchase expensive equipment, then drop it in the vicinity - bleeding their supply pool dry, radio backpacks are good for this as they are usually the most expensive item in the arsenal.

[h2]Network Infrastructure[/h2]

The radio network is how the team communicates and if you are not in signal range of your teams radios you won't be able to hear them or communicate with them. Wise Rats don't need to speak to their friends, they know what they need to do by looking at the game state, you will likely spend more time listening to the enemy channels than your own.

Your radio can be configured to change frequencies but both teams run on their own 'network' so to speak, so you will need the radio of that faction in order to listen in. USA operates on 48 MHz and Russia uses 42 MHz.

For a Rat, communications intelligence is crucial. Steal an enemy radio, and you can monitor their transmissions. Remember that when you speak on your radio, you're also audible in proximity chat - keep transmissions brief when behind enemy lines.

Radio relays in bases extend network coverage. Without coverage, a base cannot be captured. Each relay creates a 2000m radius of control and connects to other relays to form the network.

This creates your primary strategic target: destroy a relay, and you sever that base from the network. The enemy cannot spawn there, and if it's a critical junction, you've potentially isolated multiple objectives.

You can only destroy base buildings by deconstructing them, you can only deconstruct them if you are capturing the base...

[h3]Base Capturing[/h3]

As of 1.3, when you begin to capture a base the enemy cannot spawn there and must spawn at the nearest other objective and travel to defend the base. As a solo operator the fact you are able to capture the base usually means there is no one around, within the cap zone anyway of about 50m.

If you are capping the base you can use your spade to dismantle things the enemy have built within 50m of their HQ tent which is the tent with the nations flag on it, this means you can destroy radio relays preventing the enemy from spawning even if you die and cutting off the network at that node. You can also destroy their defences, buildings and other things they have spent time and resources building.

Be careful as players are now wise to this, so the meta is to put the relay outside of the 50m of the headquarters tent, so you can't destroy it on your own and will need someone else to cap the point while you destroy the relay.

A further word of caution is that if you destroy everything and capture the point then your team has to rebuild everything themselves to make the point operational again, bear that in mind and have a think about how likely it is that the enemy will flip the point again before going scorched-earth on everything.
[h2]Base Building[/h2]

After capturing a base, you can construct buildings. Know their purpose and priority because inversely you can use this to destroy things in enemy bases when you can:

[list]
[*][b]Radio Relay[/b]: Primary target - disables respawns and network connection.
[*][b]Heavy Vehicle Depot[/b]: Allows truck spawns, holds 3400 resources.
[*][b]Light Vehicle Depot[/b]: Enables jeep spawns.
[*][b]Gas Station[/b]: Increases spawn fuel from 25% to 75%.
[*][b]Living Quarters[/b]: Reduces respawn costs, allows AI defenders.
[*][b]Arsenal[/b]: Provides weapon access, moderate supply storage.
[*][b]Hospital[/b]: Medical functions, high storage capacity.
[*][b]Helipad[/b]: Enables helicopters, requires higher rank.
[/list]

[h2]Combat System[/h2]

Arma Reforger is a hardcore mil-sim style shooter meaning:

[list]
[*]Weapons come pre-zeroed based on doctrine (440m Russian, 300m US).
[*]One well-placed shot can kill instantly.
[*]Default equipment is actually quite effective - don't waste resources on fancy kit. RPGs then silencers are your staple go to equipment takes.
[*]Stance affects accuracy, silhouette, and mobility.
[*]Weapon parts (suppressors, scopes) can be swapped in field by holding interact.
[*]Enemies that go down are often unconscious and injured, meaning you have to make sure they are dead.
[*]You can loot items from enemy or friendly bodies and use them on your own equipment i.e. you can take a fallen ally's silencer even if you don't have the rank to get one at the arsenal.
[/list]

Russian and American weapons have different zeroing philosophies. Press increase range button once for 100m/200m zeroing - better for close combat and most engagements. I personally zero everything to 200m, this is reliably across both factions weaponry then.

[h2]Health System[/h2]

Arma Reforger has a health system, each limb can bleed, be broken or injured. You get the following things to help with that:

[list]
[*]Bandages to stop bleeding.
[*]Tourniquet to quickly stop bleeding, these can be taken off and replaced with a bandage. These are painful to your character so can affect mobility and accuracy.
[*]Morphine to accelerate healing and revive unconscious allies. Use of morphine will heal limbs and the associated accuracy / movement costs.
[*]Saline to replace blood loss though this is rarely utilised in the current meta.
[/list]

Rats should stock up on medical supplies, you spawn with two bandages and one morphine you should seek to get as much of them as you can to last extended deployments. In my time playing the game tourniquet's are not much use, and you can forgo these. 
[h2]Vehicle Mechanics[/h2]

Understanding the use of vehicles will help your Ratting escapades:

[list]
[*]All vehicles require resources to spawn - destroying them costs the enemy resources.
[*]Vehicles come with wrench and gas can in cargo, most vehicles have a trunk and this may contain medical supplies or other items of use.
[*]Each vehicle has specific vulnerabilities (to be detailed in Vehicle Tactics section in a later update).
[*]You can use your knife on the end of your rifle as a bayonet to pop the tyres on most vehicles, though some require 2 - 3 hits.
[/list]

When operating deep in enemy territory, never park your escape vehicle near your target. Hide it at least 200m away in dense cover.
[h2]Rank System[/h2]

Your rank affects the items you can pickup from an arsenal and your ability to command the AI. For Rats you won't need to command the AI but you will need to use enemy and friendly arsenals, rank affects your use of both.

[list]
[*]Private: Starting rank, basic access
[*]Corporal: Improved equipment options
[*]Sergeant: Access to advanced vehicles, limited AI command
[*]Lieutenant: Full helicopter and AI command capabilities
[/list]

Ranks reset each match. Gain XP through capturing bases, building structures, destroying enemy assets, and combat.

[b]Remember[/b] - Killing the enemy in their own uniform reduces your rank in 1.3 and ultimately can demote you below private to [b]renegade[/b] where you no longer have access to any arsenal friend or foe. Some servers will kick players of renegade rank.

[h2]Communication[/h2]

Communication in Arma Reforger is local proximity chat and radio chat, bear in mind if you are talking on your radio you can be heard in proximity chat, like in real life.

[list]
[*]Proximity Voice: Anyone nearby can hear you
[*]Team Radio (48 MHz US/42 MHz Russia): Reaches all teammates, even across map
[*]Squad Radio: Limited to your squad members
[/list]

For the solo Rat, the most valuable communication asset is a stolen enemy radio. This lets you monitor their movements and, if you're feeling particularly devious, transmit false information on their channels.

[h2]Mobile Spawn Points[/h2]

Two critical tools for the persistent Rat:

[list]
[*][b]Deployed Radio[/b]: Each squad can deploy one field radio providing 10 spawns. Essential for maintaining presence in contested areas. A solo Rat can use a radio to remain an annoyance in any particular area.
[*][b]Mobile Command Units[/b]: Special trucks that function as faction-wide respawn points and extend radio coverage. Eliminating these should be a priority target when encountered.
[/list]

[h2]The Rat's Edge[/h2]

Reforger's systems aren't designed for solo players, but they're perfectly exploitable by them. While squads focus on front-line objectives, you target the infrastructure supporting them:

[list]
[*]Destroy radio relays to isolate bases
[*]Ambush supply / reinforcement routes to starve resources
[*]Capture undefended network nodes to sever connections
[*]Remove resources through arsenal waste
[*]Monitor enemy communications for intelligence
[/list]

One Rat who understands these systems can disrupt enemy operations far beyond their number.
