[quote]“If the enemy can see you, and you are within range of his weapon system, he can engage and possibly kill you. So, you must be concealed from enemy observation and have cover from enemy fire. When the terrain does not provide natural cover and concealment, you must prepare your cover and use natural and man-made materials to camouflage yourself, your equipment, and your position.”[/quote]

[quote]The Warrior Ethos & Combat Skills[/quote]

The use of concealment and cover is an essential infantryman technique that has kept soldiers alive for hundreds of years. Rats, as solo operators out in the field, literally live and die by their aptitude to identify and stick to proper cover and concealment.

[h2]1. Utilising Cover and Concealment[/h2]

Cover protects you from enemy fire. Concealment hides you from enemy observation. Neither guarantees both.

Natural cover includes terrain features like rocks, hills, and trees. Man-made cover includes trenches, sandbags, and vehicles. When the terrain offers neither, camouflage becomes your only option — match your uniform and equipment to the environment.

Concealment in Arma Reforger consists mainly of bushes, grass, and shadows. 

[b]There's a catch:[/b] grass and shadows render at player-defined distances for performance reasons. While you're lying “concealed” in tall grass, enemies with low graphics settings see you sprawled in open ground. This affects most tactical shooters, not just Reforger.

[b][i]Assume all grass is invisible — it is useless to you as concealment![/i][/b]

Some games force shadow rendering, but grass remains optional. You can't rely on vegetation for concealment. When in doubt, use hard cover or terrain depressions instead.

[h3]Silhouette and Skylining[/h3]

Silhouetting / Skylining occurs when a Rat’s outline is visible against a contrasting background, making detection likely even at a distance. Moving across open ground without cover creates a distinct shape the enemy can easily spot. Skylining is a specific form of silhouetting that happens when a Rat moves along the crest of a hill or ridge. Against the lighter sky, the body forms a clear, dark outline, presenting a perfect target.

To avoid this, Rats must move below the tops of hills and ridgelines whenever possible, staying against broken backgrounds such as vegetation or uneven terrain. Pausing on high ground must be avoided; even brief exposure can betray a Rat’s position. Darkness offers no protection — figures against the night sky remain easily visible.

A Rat who fails to control their silhouette will be seen. A Rat who is seen will be killed.

[h3]Camera View, Posture, Concealment, and Cover[/h3]

Arma Reforger's multiplayer servers can be set up to either only allow first-person gameplay or to support both first- and third-person perspectives. Always check the view setting that is being used when you join a server. You can do this by pressing the mapped change perspective key or button. If the view switches from first to third person, you are on a third-person server; if you are unable to switch back to the third-person view, you are on a first person server. What you can do in concealment and cover will be affected largely by the view modes available to you.

Some players prefer to use first-person view exclusively. Others will take full advantage of third-person mode and play in a hybrid of 1pp and 3pp (1st / 3rd Person Perspective). The most significant advantage of third-person view is [b]third-person peeking[/b], that is the ability to see over or around cover without exposing your body. This provides a clear field of vision while denying the enemy the opportunity to engage. In terms of tactical leverage, this is considerable.

Rats do not fight fair. If the server allows third-person view, you are expected to use the third-person peek. Every player on the server has access to the same tools and, especially on consoles, the vast majority of players will be doing the same thing. Choosing not to use third-person peeking when it is available is a self-imposed handicap.

[b]Posture Controls[/b] are a critical component of concealment and visual discipline. In Arma Reforger, you can adjust your character’s stance incrementally using the Control key and scroll wheel. Each base stance, standing, crouching and prone can be fine-tuned through several sublevels, like this:

[code]
STANDING    ┌─ Level 5 (tallest)
            ├─ Level 4
            ├─ Level 3
            ├─ Level 2
            └─ Level 1 (lowest) ← Best for 3PP peeking

CROUCHING   ┌─ Level 5 (tallest)
            ├─ Level 4
            ├─ Level 3
            ├─ Level 2
            └─ Level 1 (lowest)

PRONE       (Single height only)
[/code]

[b]The Golden Rule: Go as low as possible while keeping the camera advantage.[/b]

Simply — you should configure your character to be as low as possible while still maintaining the camera height benefits of the stance 'mode' you are currently in. The [b]standing stance[/b] provides the highest third-person camera elevation, offering the broadest field of view. However, this also exposes the largest silhouette and target for the enemy. By adjusting your posture to the [b]lowest possible setting within the standing stance[/b], you retain the high camera perspective while significantly reducing your visible profile. This allows you to observe your surroundings from cover with reduced risk of exposure.

The crouched, and prone postures offer reduced height and improved concealment, but with corresponding decreases in mobility and camera elevation. In third-person view, the camera lowers as your posture changes from standing to crouched to prone, reducing your observational advantage.

When moving, remember [b]that your character keeps its height setting when you stop — unless you switch between standing/crouching/prone, which resets it to default.[/b] That means if you are in a low crouch when you sprint crouch from cover to cover, when you stop, your character model will resume at the 'level' you were at before you moved.
[h3]Hiding in Bushes[/h3]

Bush concealment is fundamental in Arma and a trick as old as time. As a Rat you will depend on hiding within bushes on a very regular basis to go unseen. Often, hiding in a bush concealment in plain view of the enemy is safer than hiding behind cover in terms of not being detected. Both Russian and American uniforms blend well with Reforger's foliage, especially the US disruptive patterns.

Two factors determine success: positioning and camera control. This technique works on both server types but excels in third-person for the obvious reasons.

[b]Basic Technique:[/b]

[list]
[*]Enter bush and crouch — provides the best balance of concealment and visibility.
[*]Lower your stance further with Ctrl + scroll wheel.
[*]Aim weapon downward to tuck your profile into foliage.
[*]Double-tap Left Ctrl for weapon low-ready (reduces barrel exposure).
[*]Hold Alt for free look (observe without moving).
[*]Double-tap Alt to lock free look for extended observation.
[/list]

[b]Third-Person Advantages:[/b] Crouching in 3PP keeps your camera elevated above foliage while your body stays hidden. In 1PP, you only see what your character sees, so you have to give up concealment for the sake of visibility.

[b]First-Person Considerations:[/b]

[list]
[*]Position deep enough that foliage obscures your upper body and partially obscures your view, that way you know your chest / weapon are not sticking obviously out of the brush.
[*]Accept some visual obstruction — clear view means you're exposed, branches and leaves should be in your way.
[*]Be more mindful of your weapon barrel and where it is sticking out, adopting the low ready position can help.
[/list]

[b]Tactical Trade-offs:[/b] If lowering your weapon to improve concealment just bear in mind it leads to a reactionary gap. In low-risk areas, prioritise concealment. In high-risk zones, keep weapon ready despite the larger profile.

[b]Key Warnings:[/b]
[list]
[*]Prone positioning often exposes legs beyond the bush edge, particularly to flanking enemies hence why crouching is almost universally better.
[*]Your weapon barrel can betray your position even when your body is well-concealed. 
[*]Remember that bushes provide no protection from incoming fire — they hide you, they don't shield you. 
[*]Your concealment needs will vary depending on your mission: total invisibility for reconnaissance may require accepting heavy visual obstruction, while ambush positions demand a balance between concealment and clear firing lines.
[/list]

Hiding in bushes will allow you to hide in plain sight, often, the enemy will not see you until they are literally standing on top of you. I have had players walk over me in foliage and still not know I am there (somehow).
[h3]Actions as Concealment[/h3]

Rats can do a lot to help their stealth capability by being wary and mindful of their actions and how they might give them away. Light discipline means not using your torch, turning off headlights on your vehicles and so on.

Most gaming monitors have a gamma or night vision capability, and this is how the majority of players can see at night.

Rats don't fight fair, neither does anyone else, if you have it, you should use it.

[b]Noise[/b] — Any form of movement makes noise, in the current state of the game you [i]speed[/i] dictates how loud you are, the slower you are, the quieter you are. [b]Your posture / stance does not affect how loud you are currently![/b] Bear that in mind.

Vegetation and terrain features such as bushes, undergrowth, and branches aggravate movement noise, with snapping twigs or rustling foliage revealing a Rat’s approach long before they are seen. 

If you are operating near enemies, you need to mask your sounds, or you will be compromised and you will die. Time your movement with other in-game sounds to help mask the sound of you moving. Move when the enemy is moving, firing, talking on their radio, or the wind is blowing through the trees and foliage.

[b]Radio Comms[/b] — Talking in prox. chat is obviously going to give you away, but bear in mind that when you [b]talk on your team / squad radio, your character will also talk in prox. chat[/b] as you would expect to happen in real life.

[b]Totally silent faction / squad chat[/b] is achievable by using the text chat function on PC, to get messages to your team with your character model remaining completely silent. Just make sure you're not typing into global chat!

[b]Movement discipline[/b] — Do not move without having a reason to move and a plan of where you are going and what you will do if you are suddenly compromised. Motion invites observation and creates noise, the human eye is naturally attracted to movement and gamers finely tuned to the sound of footsteps. If you have to move, continue using cover and concealment, crossing open ground must be avoided unless you have literally no other choice. If you [i]must[/i] walk across open ground, time it well, move as quickly as you can and try to use 'dead ground', which is an area of terrain where natural dips folds or obstacles obscure enemy sight of you.
[h3]Why Rats Get Seen[/h3]

Despite following the principles of cover and concealment Rats are often still seen and exterminated in the wild. This is because Rats misunderstand concealment. Staying hidden relies on you applying the principles we have covered in this section in combination with understand [b]how your enemy will see you.[/b]

[b]Visual detection[/b] is the primary threat to solo operators. The enemy does not need to see your entire body or gear, they only need to spot one small thing that does not belong. A shape that breaks a natural pattern, a shadow where none should fall, a flick of movement in the stillness.

Some things to consider:

[b]The human brain is an expert in pattern recognition[/b]. It knows what to expect on maps like Everon. Empty buildings. Abandoned vehicles. Deserted roads. When everything should be lifeless, any sign of movement or presence triggers immediate attention. This is why a helmet edge in a window draws your eye from hundreds of meters away. It violates the expected pattern. Choose positions that match the context of the environment you are in.

[b]Movement is your greatest enemy.[/b] The human eye glosses over static shapes but locks onto motion instantly. You can remain invisible at 50 meters until you shift position, then get spotted at 300. Even turning your head creates detectable change against a still background. This creates the Rat's dilemma: movement is necessary for mission success but deadly for concealment. Time your movements, plan your escape vector, movement discipline is key to your success.

[b]Shadows conceal, but they also betray.[/b] You can third-person peak from behind the corner of a house all you want. Just remember, if the sun is in the right position, your long shadow on the ground is giving you away and the enemy is looking to flank you. Be wary of the changing light conditions and how they affect your concealment.
[h3]Fighting Positions / Hides / Ratholes[/h3]

A hide is a static position from which the Rat will observe from, engage from if necessary, and fall back to to survive. A hide is a deliberate spot selected by you in your area of operations, and the use of such pre-determined hides can be a key element to remaining undetected or surviving if compromised.

When selecting a hide, even a temporary one you only intend to use for a few moments or minutes — you must briefly consider the following factors.

[b]Selection Standards[/b] — The ideal hide provides a clear field of fire while wherever possible denying the enemy a clean shot back. A second floor window overlooking a crossroads allows engagement while the walls offer protection, for example. A hillside position looking down into an exposed piece of road is an ideal hide and position to set up an ambush.

[b]Escape Planning[/b] — You need to know how you are going to escape your position if you are pushed by the enemy, remember, Rats are cowards and do not go down in blazes of glory if they can help it. Do not allow yourself to be cornered. When picking a hide you need to briefly think 'What am I going to do and where am I going to go, if this position is compromised?'

A good hide has two avenues of escape dependent on the direction you need to go, you should have identified these routes when entering the hide for the firs time.
