[h1]3. MOVEMENT[/h1]


Movement is survival, but careless movement is suicide. Every journey across the battlefield demands careful consideration of terrain, timing, and threat level.

Watch any typical player, and you'll see them sprint straight from spawn to objective, only to catch a round in the head as they cross the final open field. Ten minutes of running ended in two seconds of poor decision-making. This is what happens when players move without thinking.

Smart movement follows a simple framework: plan your route as a series of waypoints, not a straight line. At each waypoint, execute the SLL protocol — Stop, Look, Listen. Take 10–30 seconds to scan your surroundings and listen for movement before continuing. This brief pause creates the reaction gap that keeps you alive when contact happens.

Route selection matters more than speed. Choose paths through low ground, vegetation, and broken terrain. Those ridgelines might offer great views, but they also silhouette you against the sky — making you visible to every sniper within a kilometre. That open field might save you two minutes of walking, but is two minutes worth respawning and starting over?

The environment talks if you know how to listen. In Reforger, birds scatter when players move nearby. Stop. Observe. Adjust your route accordingly.

Danger areas require special attention. Roads, trails, and riverbeds are natural ambush zones. Cross them at curves, culverts, or bridges where you have cover, never at long straight sections where you're exposed.

Your movement should match the tactical situation:

If Enemy Contact Is: [b]NOT LIKELY[/b]
Move By: [i]Walking / Running / Driving[/i]

If Enemy Contact Is: [b]POSSIBLE[/b]  
Move By: [i]Walking / Running, with frequent Stop / Look / Listen pauses[/i]

If Enemy Contact Is: [b]EXPECTED[/b]
Move By: [i]Walking only, maximum Stop / Look / Listen discipline[/i]

Movement without purpose gets you killed. Take the extra minute to move smart. The player who rushes blindly into contact rarely survives long enough to learn from their mistakes.
[h3]Moving From Cover[/h3]

Once you've been firing from a position, assume you're marked. The enemy knows your location, and they're waiting for your head to pop up again. This is when most players die — trying to re-engage from a compromised position.

Never stand up where you went down. Instead, crawl or roll several metres to either side before coming up. The enemy's crosshairs are on your last position. Make them adjust. That split-second of confusion might save your life.

When you must cross open ground, use what soldiers call the “3-5 second rush.” This isn't arbitrary timing — it's based on human reaction time and weapon handling. Most players need 2–3 seconds to acquire a moving target, adjust their aim, and fire accurately. By limiting your exposure to 5 seconds maximum, you stay inside their reaction window.

Here's how it works: Pick your next cover point before you move. When you break from cover, sprint full speed for 3–5 seconds, then hit the dirt. Don't stop because the timer says so — stop when you reach cover. If you're caught in the open, go prone, roll once to throw off their aim, then rush again.

The key is unpredictability. Never establish a pattern. Sometimes rush for 3 seconds, sometimes 5. Sometimes roll right, sometimes left. Keep them guessing.
