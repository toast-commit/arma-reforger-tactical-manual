[h1]3. MOVEMENT[/h1]


Movement is necessary, but undisciplined movement invites detection and destruction. Movement is a constant exercise in judgment, terrain reading, and restraint.

Successful movement relies on strict adherence to basic principles:

Stop, look, and listen (SLL) before moving and after moving. Identify your next position and plan your route before leaving cover, when you arrive, stop, look and listen again for 10 - 30 seconds before departing once more. Movement without a plan risks crossing open areas, exposing your silhouette, or creating unnecessary noise.

Whenever possible, select routes that offer natural cover and concealment. Move through low ground, vegetation, depressions, and broken terrain. Avoid walking across cleared areas or the tops of hills and ridgelines. Movement along elevated ground will skyline your silhouette against the sun or moon, making you visible from great distance.

Remain alert to environmental cues. Birds or animals that suddenly scatter may indicate the presence of enemy forces nearby. Pause, observe, and adjust your movement accordingly.

When crossing danger areas such as roads, trails, or riverbeds, choose crossing points with the most available cover such as low spots, culverts, curves, or bridges rather than open straightaways.

Movement must be adapted based on the likelihood of enemy contact. The following guidance applies:

[code]
|If Enemy Contact Is:|Move By:|
|---|---|
|NOT LIKELY|Walking / Running / Driving|
|POSSIBLE|Walking / Running, with frequent Stop / Look / Listen pauses|
|EXPECTED|Walking only, maximum Stop / Look / Listen discipline|
[/code]

Movement is a constant risk. Your ability to move silently, unseen, and intelligently determines your survival. Rats do not rush blindly. They move with purpose or they do not move at all.
[h3]Moving From Cover[/h3]

If you have been firing from one position for some time, the enemy may have spotted you and may be waiting for you to come up from behind cover. So, before rushing forward, roll or crawl a short distance from your position. By coming up from another spot, you may fool an enemy who is aiming at one spot and waiting for you to rise. When the route to your next position is through an open area, use the 3 to 5 second rush (detailed in the next chapter). When necessary, hit the ground, roll right or left, and then rush again.
[h3]The 3-5 Second Rush[/h3]

The rush is the fastest way to move from one position to another. Each rush should last from 3 to 5 seconds. Rushes are kept short to prevent enemies from tracking you. However, do not stop and hit the ground int he open just because 5 seconds have passed. Always try to hit the ground behind some cover. Before moving, pick out your next covered and concealed position and the best route to it.
