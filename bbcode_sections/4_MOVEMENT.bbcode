[h1]4. MOVEMENT[/h1]

Movement is survival, but careless movement is suicide. Every journey across the battlefield demands careful consideration of terrain, timing, and threat level.

Watch any typical player, and you'll see them sprint straight from spawn to objective, only to catch a round in the head as they cross the final open field. Ten minutes of running ended in two seconds of poor decision-making. This is what happens when players move without thinking.

Smart movement follows a simple framework: plan your route as a series of waypoints, not a straight line. At each waypoint, execute the SLL protocol — Stop, Look, Listen. Take 10–30 seconds to scan your surroundings and listen for movement before continuing. This brief pause creates the reactionary gap that keeps you alive when contact happens.

Once you start putting this into practice you will be able to count up the number of times that SLL has allowed you to notice the enemy, get ready for them and win any engagement. You will find that plenty of players do indeed run aimlessly and pretty much in a straight line to where they are going a lot of the time, it makes them easy to pick off. Simply stopping to listen and observe, even if most of the time you have no cause for concern and continue onwards, will save your life countless times.

Route selection matters more than speed. Choose paths through low ground, vegetation, and broken terrain. Hills and ridgelines might offer great views, but they also silhouette you against the sky — making you visible to every sniper or player within a kilometre. That open field might save you two minutes of walking, but is two minutes worth respawning and starting over? When your conducting Rat operations that take you 10+ minutes just to infil to where you need to be, the answer is obviously no.

Your movement should match the tactical situation:

If Enemy Contact Is: [b]NOT LIKELY[/b]
Move By: [i]Walking / Running / Driving[/i]

If Enemy Contact Is: [b]POSSIBLE[/b]  
Move By: [i]Walking / Running, with frequent Stop / Look / Listen pauses[/i]
Note: If driving, a legitimate strategy is to just barrel through as fast as you can and hope for the best, it will work more than you think.

If Enemy Contact Is: [b]EXPECTED[/b]
[b]DO NOT DRIVE![/b]
Move By: [i]Walking only, maximum Stop / Look / Listen discipline[/i]. 

Movement without purpose gets you killed. Take the extra minute to move smart. The player who rushes blindly into contact rarely survives long enough to learn from their mistakes.
[h3]Moving From Cover[/h3]

Once you've been firing from a position, assume the enemy knows your location and are waiting for your head to pop up again. This is when most players die — trying to re-engage from a compromised position. 

Never stand up where you went down. Instead, crouch or roll several metres to either side before coming up. The enemy's crosshairs are on your last position. Make them adjust. That split-second of confusion might save your life and cost them theirs.

When you must cross open ground, use what soldiers call the “3-5 second rush". Most players need 2–3 seconds to acquire a moving target, adjust their aim, and fire accurately. By limiting your exposure to 5 seconds maximum, you stay inside their reaction window.

Pick your next cover point before you move. When you break from cover, sprint full speed for 3–5 seconds, then hit the dirt. Don't stop because the timer says so — stop when you reach cover.

The key is unpredictability. Never establish a pattern. Sometimes rush for 3 seconds, sometimes 5. Sometimes roll right, sometimes left. Keep them guessing.

[i][/i]Remember — Rats survive by being where the enemy doesn't expect them. Every time you move, ask yourself - ”Where would they expect me to go?" Then go somewhere else.
[h2]URBAN MOVEMENT[/h2]

Arma Reforger features small urban environments where specialised combat principles apply. Success as a Rat in these zones demands unique skills. You'll need proficiency in urban movement, building entry techniques, room clearing, and selecting tactical positions.

For the Rat, CQC in urban areas is viable but risky. CQC tactics is covered in section 6 below. The odds nearly always favour defenders. Every "hide" you create must have escape routes that you've genuinely considered beforehand. Without proper planning, you'll get flustered when pushed. A squad storming your position quickly transforms your hideout into a coffin.

There are some tips to bear in mind when transiting through or engaging in operations in urban areas, which if you bear in mind will likely save your life on multiple occasions.

[h3]Avoid Open Areas[/h3]

Open areas such as streets, alleys, and parks should be avoided. They are natural kill zones for enemy shooters and snipers. Consider that every window facing where you are could have someone behind it, and you will see why open urban environments are so dangerous. Cross these spaces only when necessary, using smoke grenades if you know someone has a bead on you and / or the 3-5 second rush technique for protection.

The optimal path through urban environments is via rear gardens and property backsides. These routes offer plentiful cover and significantly reduce enemy visibility. Whenever possible, navigate behind buildings rather than between them. Stay off the streets.

[h3]Move Parallel to Buildings[/h3]

You may not always be able to use the rear or insides of buildings as routes of advance and may be forced onto the outside of buildings in the street. If so should move parallel to the side of the building along the building line. Stay in the shadows if you can, present as low a silhouette as you can and move rapidly to your next position.

[h3]Moving Past Windows[/h3]

Windows present an obvious hazard and the most common mistakes are exposing the head and chest in a first floor window to the enemy. Where possible stay below the window level and near the side of the building while ensuring you do not silhouette yourself in the window, you can easily do this by crouching and this way even when sprinting you are usually below the window line.

[h3]Moving Around Corners[/h3]

Corners are natural choke points and ambush zones. Entering them carelessly is fatal. The most common mistake a Rat can make is exposing their weapon barrel or full silhouette around a corner without first clearing it. If an enemy is waiting with their weapon trained, even a brief exposure results in death.

Do not approach a corner too closely. In most modern FPS, getting too tight to the wall will cause your character to raise their weapon into a non-ready position. Though it will snap back into place when you step out, the reaction delay can cost you your life. Always maintain a slight offset from the wall so your weapon remains ready.

Wherever possible, you should 'pie' the corner. Pieing is a deliberate clearing method where you slice the angle gradually in controlled steps, like slicing a pie. Instead of swinging wide and out of the corner exposing yourself, you move in wide arc, exposing only a narrow segment of the new area at a time. This method gives you a shifting field of view while keeping your profile small. Done correctly, pieing the corner allows you to clear unknown threats without over-committing. Your weapons remains in the ready position and your movements are controlled.

However, if you already know the enemy's position because you've seen movement, heard a reload or spotted something that gives the enemy away, then you should not pie. [b]You should pre-fire the corner.[/b]

[h3]Pre-Firing A Corner[/h3]

In the next section of this guide, we will discuss how violence of action wins the majority of engagements in CQC encounters. Pre-firing a corner or angle is a prime example of this in action.

Pre-firing is simply beginning to fire your weapon as you strafe out of cover at the location the enemy is at. As you expose yourself you are already opening fire on the enemy. It goes without saying that fully automatic lends itself to this technique.

This is a solid technique in competitive FPS's where pre-firing combined with the reaction delay between the enemy seeing you and pulling the trigger further combined with server / client latency means if done correctly the enemy is dead as soon as you come into view and to them they inexplicably die the moment you appear. 

If you know an enemy is waiting for you then pre-firing on entry is a good way of turning the odds against the waiting defender.

[h3]Clearing T Shaped Corners[/h3]

T-shaped corners are among the most hazardous terrain features inside and out of a building. You cannot see left or right until you expose yourself — and an enemy could be lying in wait on either side, already aimed in.

If you know there is an opportunity to simply avoid this and move to a point where you will not be at such a disadvantage, then you should do so.

Most players commit blindly to one side and die for it. The smarter Rat slices both arcs gradually, exposing just a sliver of each sector in turn, as shown below:
![url=attachments/TJunctionClearingTechnique.png]T-Junction Clearing Technique[/url]

This method lets you clear both corners incrementally before fully committing. It won’t make you bulletproof, but it massively reduces the chances of walking into a static ambush.

Once you've reached the decision point and must step into the junction, [b]do not hug the wall[/b]. Defenders will almost always hold the closest edge. Instead, cut a [b]wide arc[/b] away from the wall, forcing the enemy to adjust their aim and giving you a reactionary gap. That split second can decide who wins the fight.

[h3]Entering a Building[/h3]

Conventional infantry doctrine advises against entering buildings through doors or windows whenever possible, preferring to create new entry points with demolitions, breaching charges, or tank rounds. Arma Reforger does not simulate this kind of structural destruction, and you are limited to climbing through appropriately sized windows or using the door.

That means, more often than not, you’ll be using doors and that’s a problem, because that’s where defenders will be waiting.

[b]If a window is available and accessible, you should always use it instead.[/b] Most players expect door entries. The element of surprise from entering via a window, even with the noise of the glass breaking, gives you a critical reaction gap. That gap is often enough to kill whoever is covering the obvious angle.

[b]Your character model will fit through any window pane wide enough to fit you. A lot of windows are two paned with a split down the middle, you will NOT fit through these so do not try.[/b]

If circumstances allow, [b]precede your entry with a grenade[/b]. The explosion will force defenders into cover or out of their sights, disorient them, or outright kill them. Either way, the Rat must enter [b]immediately[/b] after detonation. Any delay forfeits the advantage and gets you shot walking into the kill zone.

Do not linger at the threshold. Move, clear, and kill. This is not the time to hesitate. It is when you are in the close confines of your enemy that you then enter close quarters combat...
