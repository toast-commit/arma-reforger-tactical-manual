[h1]4. URBAN MOVEMENT[/h1]


Arma Reforger has some small urban areas and the principles of urban movement and combat do apply here. Successful Rat operations in urban areas requires skills that are unique to this type of fighting. You must be skilled in moving, entering buildings, clearing rooms and selecting and using fighting positions to be effective in this environment.

[h3]Avoid Open Areas[/h3]
Open areas such as streets, alleys and parks should be avoided, they are natural kill zones for your enemy and their snipers. They can be crossed safely with the use of smoke or the 3 - 5 second rush.

[h3]Move Parallel to Buildings[/h3]
You may not always be able to use the inside of buildings as routes of advance and may be forced onto the outside of buildings. You should move parallel to the side of the building along the building line. Stay in the shadows if you can, present as low a silhouette as you can while still moving rapidly to you next position. 

[h3]Moving Past Windows[/h3]
Windows present a hazard to the rat and the most common mistakes are exposing the head and chest in a first floor window to the enemy. Where possible stay below the window level and near the side of the building while ensuring you do not silhouette yourself in the window. 

[h3]Moving Around Corners[/h3]
Corners are natural choke points and ambush zones. Entering them carelessly is fatal. The most common mistake a Rat can make is exposing their weapon barrel or full silhouette around a corner without first clearing it. If an enemy is waiting with their weapon trained, even a brief exposure results in death.

Do not approach a corner too closely. In most modern FPS, getting too tight to the wall will cause your character to raise their weapon into a non-ready position. Though it will snap back into place when you step out, the reaction delay can cost you your life. Always maintain a slight offset from the wall so your weapon remains ready.

Wherever possible, you should 'pie' the corner. Pieing is a deliberate clearing method where you slice the angle gradually in controlled steps, like slicing a pie. Instead of swinging wide and out of the corner exposing yourself, you move in wide arc, exposing only a narrow segment of the new area at a time. This method gives you a shifting field of view while keeping your profile small. Done correctly, pieing the corner allows you to clear unknown threats without over-committing. Your weapons remains in the ready position and your movements are controlled.

However, if you already know the enemy's position because you've seen movement, heard a reload or spotted something that gives the enemy away, then you should not pie. You should pre-fire the corner.

[h3]Clearing T Shaped Corners[/h3]
T-shaped corners are among the most hazardous terrain features in any structure. You cannot see left or right until you expose yourself — and an enemy could be lying in wait on either side, already aimed in.

Most players commit blindly to one side and die for it. The smarter Rat slices both arcs gradually, exposing just a sliver of each sector in turn, as shown below:

This method lets you clear both corners incrementally before fully committing. It won’t make you bulletproof, but it massively reduces the chances of walking into a static ambush.

Once you've reached the decision point and must step into the junction, [b]do not hug the wall[/b]. Defenders will almost always hold the closest edge. Instead, cut a [b]wide arc[/b] away from the wall, forcing the enemy to adjust their aim and giving you a reactionary gap. That split second can decide who wins the fight.
[h3]Pre-Firing A Corner[/h3]

Pre-firing a corner is a deliberate offensive technique used in close-quarters engagements where the enemy’s position is known with confidence. It is particularly effective when the target is isolated and unlikely to be supported by additional contacts.

The method involves engaging a pre-identified location before fully exposing oneself beyond cover. To execute a pre-fire, align your weapon sights on the suspected enemy location, begin lateral movement away from the cover, and initiate fire just before crossing the visual threshold of the corner. Initial rounds may impact the wall or cover, but as the shooter clears the corner, rounds should fall directly on target.

This technique exploits network latency and peeker’s advantage inherent in online environments. When timed correctly, it allows the shooter to place rounds on the enemy before the enemy’s client registers the shooter's full exposure. From the enemy's perspective, it may appear as though they were eliminated before the shooter was fully visible.

Pre-firing is not speculative. It is a calculated strike against a confirmed or highly probable threat location. When combined with accurate shot placement and decisive movement, it gives the solo Rat a critical edge in first-contact engagements.

[h3]Entering a Building[/h3]

Conventional infantry doctrine advises against entering buildings through doors or windows whenever possible, preferring to create new entry points with demolitions, breaching charges, or tank rounds. Arma Reforger does not simulate this kind of structural destruction, and you are limited to climbing through appropriately sized windows or using the door.

That means, more often than not, you’ll be using doors and that’s a problem, because that’s where defenders will be waiting.

[b]If a window is available and accessible, you should always use it instead.[/b] Most players expect door entries. The element of surprise from entering via a window, even with the noise of the glass breaking, gives you a critical reaction gap. That gap is often enough to kill whoever is covering the obvious angle.

If circumstances allow, [b]precede your entry with a grenade[/b]. The explosion will force defenders into cover or out of their sights, disorient them, or outright kill them. Either way, the Rat must enter [b]immediately[/b] after detonation. Any delay forfeits the advantage and gets you shot walking into the kill zone.

Do not linger at the threshold. Move, clear, and kill. This is not the time to hesitate. It is when you are in the close confines of your enemy that you then enter close quarters combat...
