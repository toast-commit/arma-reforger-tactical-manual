[h1]5. CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT (CQC)[/h1]


CQC represents the most volatile, unforgiving and lethal form of engagement available to the Rat, or any soldier for that matter. It occurs inside buildings, confined spaces or within narrow urban terrain areas. In these areas visibility is is limited, movement constrained and combat takes place at distances measured in metres or less.

If you are entering a building to clear it of a known threat, this is CQC. If you are being rushed by an enemy while you are hiding in an bush on the outskirts of a base, this becomes CQC.

Any combat that occurs in close quarters is CQC. I know this sounds obvious but knowing when to apply the below principles will help you survive.

In real-world doctrine, CQC is universally recognised as high-risk. In Arma Reforger, it becomes exponentially more dangerous due to several factors including client-server latency, clipping and occasionally de-sync.

Even with perfect technique, the odds in CQC favour the defender. Any player holding a corner or angle already has their weapon raised, often aimed at the doorway. They enjoy the luxury of cover, positioning and time. The Rat, by contrast, must breach, identify and engage all while exposed.

It is for this reason that it is almost universally recommend in nearly all circumstances to simply hold an overwatch of a known occupied building, and wait out the occupant or take a shot through the windows. It is also recommend to simply bypass the building altogether if an enemy is known to be occupying it, instead moving around its arcs of fire and waiting for the enemy to leave again.

There are only two scenarios where CQC may become necessary:
[list]
[*]An enemy unexpectedly occupies the same structure or terrain as you.
[*]A known high value threat is inside a building and must be eliminated (a sniper, an enemy Rat, an anti-vehicle specialist)
[/list]

When these conditions apply, the Rat must abandon hesitation and commit to the doctrine of [b]overwhelming violence of action[/b].

[h3]Violence of Action[/h3]
Violence of action is the defining characteristic of the Rat’s engagements. While stealth, evasion, and deception are the default tools of survival, there comes a moment when the Rat must strike. When that moment arrives, it must be executed with [b]overwhelming force, speed, and decisiveness[/b].

[b]Violence of action[/b] is the sudden application of surprise, aggression, and dominance to seize the initiative and eliminate the enemy before they can react. It is not optional. It is not negotiable. [b]Hesitation equals death.[/b]

In Close Quarters Combat, the psychology of the engagement matters as much as the tactics. If the Rat hesitates, the Rat dies. Creeping slowly, inching forward, checking every corner with tentative movement these all serve the defender. The Rat must instead force the fight and shatter the defender’s expectations. Time is not an ally. Every second spent pieing a corner or checking a doorway allows the enemy to reposition, reload, heal, or brace for your entry.

The Rat must act with deliberate speed, aggression, and intent. Movement must be assertive. Targets must be engaged the moment they are seen. Time spent in the kill zone must be kept to an absolute minimum.

Pre-firing is the standard operating procedure. If a door is likely occupied, pre-fire it. If a corner is suspect, pre-fire it. If you do not have the ammunition to pre-fire your entries, you do not have the ammunition to conduct a CQC assault and should abort.

[b]If you still have a grenade in your inventory and are about to breach a suspected occupied room, use it.[/b] If you're about to enter a room you suspect is occupied precede the breach with a grenade and go in immediately after detonation. The Rat does not linger, go in fast, aggressive and loud while the enemy is still disoriented or dead.

Pre-fire doorways and angles using short, controlled bursts. Do not waste ammunition spraying wildly. The goal is suppression and reaction delay, not panic fire.

CQC requires tempo dominance. The Rat must move faster than the defender can process, forcing mistakes and creating gaps in their response. Most defenders expect a slow breach. When you enter with speed and violence of action, you throw off their rhythm, forcing rushed and inaccurate reactions. Their plan breaks down. Yours takes effect.

If the defender is behind a door and has already revealed their presence—whether by pre-firing, footstep noise, gear movement or voice comms—listen for signs of [b]dead time[/b]: reloading, healing, opening the inventory, switching weapons or speaking. These are your windows. The moment you hear any of them, breach and shoot. Do not wait. Do not hesitate. If you delay, they will recover, and you will die.
[h3]How to Clear Doors[/h3]

Clearing a door is one of the most dangerous actions a Rat can take in CQC. Every doorway is a potential choke point, a bottleneck where defenders enjoy the greatest advantage. This zone is known as the fatal funnel, a narrow area in and immediately beyond the doorway where all incoming movement is focused and where defenders will distinctively aim.

The Rat must consider every doorway as a know hazard. After pre-firing the door they now have to open it - the picture below advises on the best practice of opening the door:
![url=attachments/DoorClearingTechnique.png]Door Clearing Technique[/url]
Much like real life Arma Reforger allows you to open the door side on as shown in the image, depending on the type of door and the hallway the Rat should immediately step back from the door to give space for them to go on to pie the angles in the room. Ideally when pieing the angles into the room you should be as far away from the door as is possible while still maintaining visual contact within so as to reduce your silhouette to the defender. [b]Do not crouch while doing this, defenders will likely be aiming for your centre mass and crouching lowers your face directly into the sight picture.[/b]

[h3]Slicing the Pie[/h3]
Once the door is opened, you slice the pie by clearing the interior of the room in small segments without entering. The ideal scenario is that the Rat is able to clear the room without entering the fatal funnel or being forced to breach into the room itself. The Rat moves incrementally along the outer arc of the doorway, slowly revealing more of the room slice by slice, as shown below:
![url=attachments/DoorFatalFunnel.png]Door Fatal Funnel[/url]
Each lateral movement reveals a new “slice” of the interior, allowing you to scan corners and engage targets before they see you. This technique gives the Rat a fighting chance at spotting an enemy who may be holding an angle but hasn't yet seen your approach.

This method is safest when used from a distance not right up against the doorframe. Being too close limits your arc of vision and increases the likelihood of weapon clipping or poor corner geometry revealing your position. Maintain at least one body’s width back from the threshold to keep your weapon in a ready state and ensure maximum field of view.

If the room is shallow, with poor angles or limited cover, and you can confirm it’s clear through slicing do not enter. There is no tactical value in occupying a cleared space that offers no concealment, no advantage, and puts you at risk.

However, if your pie reveals nothing and corners remain unclear, because of doors that open inward for example, or you visually confirm a threat you have been unable to engage you must either:
[list]
[*]Pre-fire and breach using overwhelming violence of action.
[*]Withdrawn and reassess your approach.
[/list]

Never, ever 'creep' the final corner, never lean slowly into an uncleared space. 

You are either clearing or you are breaching. Hesitation will get you killed.

Slicing the pie is your first port of call to clear a room, use it to avoid having to engage in CWC if possible, but once the door is open, you are on the clock. Every second you spend standing in the funnel increases your already exceedingly high risk of death.
[h3]Room Entry[/h3]
Most tactical literature assumes that more than one person is clearing rooms. With two or more Rats, angles can be split, sectors controlled and breaches covered. The Rat however more often than not will be on their own. This means every room entry is a gamble as you expose your body to a potential ambush with no backup to cover your flanks. Breaching a room solo is the most dangerous action you can take in CQC and it should only happen after slicing the pie has revealed a significant portion of the interior.

Room entry begins where slicing ends; when you've cleared every slice of the pie you can from the outside and you now need to breach to clear any remaining blind spots. This is usually the space behind the door, deep corners or anywhere line of sight was occluded dependent on the layout of the room.

The doorway itself, the fatal funnel as we mentioned above, is the killzone where [b]you[/b] die. It is where the defenders are most likely aiming. The longer you are there the higher your chance of death, once you commit to a room breach, you must move immediately, quickly and decisively.
![url=attachments/DoorEntry.png]Door Entry[/url]
As the image shows, the Rat selects an entry vector that aggressively slices away from the most likely threat position. This usually means entering at an oblique angle sweeping wide away from the doorframe while aiming into the uncleared corner. Doors that open into the room you are clearing may have enemies hiding behind them. If you've sliced the rest of the room this is usually the final blind spot and it is where you must go first.

Once inside, pivot rapidly to cover the angles as you move. Do not stop inside the room unless it is clear, motion is a potent defence in these situations. Hesitation and delay gives a waiting defender time to correct their aim.

Once a room is clear, get out and do the next one.
[h3]Clearing Stairs[/h3]

Stairs, much like the rest of CQC movement are incredibly dangerous places for the Rat to find themselves if a defender is possibly within the building and potentially defending the staircase. They are vertical funnels with zero cover, limited movement options and any movement up or down them is incredibly predictable.
![url=attachments/StairClear.png]Stair Clear[/url]
In squad doctrine staircases are handled with mini bounding overwatch movements and splitting angles. For the solo Rat however none of that exists. You either creep up slowly as most players do and get blasted the second your helmet enters the frame, or you rush.

The correct approach is to pie the base of the stairs first, for any persons stood on the first landing if there is one and then [b]rush[/b]. Violence of action on defended stairs is a necessity and is your only chance out of your already slim chances of survival, I reiterate that if at all possible you should avoid having to clear an occupied building.

You rush stairs because defenders are likely holding an angle that will have your head in it the moment you approach, the defender is relying on your slowly creeping up so they can shoot the Rat in the face. Do the opposite instead and rush them.

By rushing them you disrupt their sight picture, break their rhythm and will force them to adjust their aim as you barrel towards them. It is during this reactionary gap that you kill or be killed.

[h3]Hallways[/h3]
A hallway is simply a very large fatal funnel, never stand in the middle of it, cling to the walls the doors are on, and try and avoid the angles from which you could be sprayed through a door as you pass through the hallways as much as you can.
