[h1]5. CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT (CQC)[/h1]

CQC represents the most volatile, unforgiving and lethal form of engagement available to the Rat, or any soldier for that matter. CQC is not restricted to buildings. A surprise contact in dense vegetation becomes CQC, someone popping up from cover to shoot at you 5 metres away is CQC. Any engagement where reaction time shrinks to milliseconds qualifies as close quarters combat. The principles below apply whenever combat distance collapses, regardless of terrain.

In real-world doctrine, CQC is universally recognised as high-risk. In Arma Reforger, it becomes exponentially more dangerous due to client/server latency and occasionally de-sync.

It is for these reasons that the Rat lives by the adage of only engaging when they know they are at an overwhelming advantage. Consciously entering CQC should only be done deliberately if you know, [i]beyond all doubt[/i], that you are in a position of such strong advantage the enemy has almost no chance to survive.

You attack by surprise, you attack with overwhelming force. It is in these moments when the Rat is faced with entering CQC, either because they choose to unleash it on the enemy or because it is unleashed on them, that the Rat must abandon hesitation and commit to the doctrine of [b]overwhelming violence of action[/b].
[h3]Violence of Action[/h3]

Violence of action is key to winning almost any engagement. While stealth, evasion, and deception are the default tools of survival and getting you [i]to[/i] the fight, there comes a moment when the Rat must have the fight itself. When that moment arrives, it must be executed ideally on your terms but in any case with [b]overwhelming force, speed, and decisiveness.[/b] 

[b]Violence of action[/b] is the sudden application of surprise, aggression, and dominance to seize the initiative and eliminate the enemy before they can react. It is not optional. It is not negotiable. [b]Hesitation equals death in CQC engagements.[/b]

In Close Quarters Combat, victory usually belongs to whoever strikes first with decisive force. The terms “attacker” and “defender” become meaningless — only initiative matters. A defender caught by surprise dies just as quickly as an attacker walking into an ambush. Position means nothing if you don't see it coming.

CQC is usually won at the moment of first contact. The player who achieves tactical surprise — who gets “the drop” — almost always wins. This advantage can shift in milliseconds. A camping player loses all defensive benefits the moment an enemy appears from an unexpected angle. An aggressive rusher becomes the victim when walking into a pre-aimed weapon. Yet paradoxically the defender holding an angle becomes the victim when the attacker moves faster than they can keep up with and causes them to miss their initial shot.

The OODA loop — Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — governs every combat engagement. Break down how you deal with an engagement in close quarters, play it in your mind in slow motion, you will note that you and your enemy are spinning the OODA loop constantly. In CQC, both players race through this cycle in fractions of a second, but the one who completes it first gains the advantage. More critically, the player who disrupts their enemy's OODA loop while completing their own wins the fight.

Violence of action weaponises this principle. When you strike with speed and aggression, you force the enemy to restart their OODA loop. They observe your attack, must reorient to your unexpected aggression and speed, struggle to decide under pressure, and act too late. By the time they complete their cycle, you're already into your second or third loop — adjusting fire, moving to better position, or finishing the kill.

Have you ever been rushed when holding an angle in a building, missed all your shots as the attacker bore down on you and killed you while you struggled to even readjust your aim? That is violence of action in play.

This is why hesitation kills in CQC. Every pause extends your OODA loop. Every moment of indecision gives the enemy time to complete theirs. The Rat who acts decisively — even if imperfectly — forces the enemy into a reactive state they cannot escape.

When CQC is initiated, whether by choice or circumstance, commit fully. Half-measures guarantee failure. Full automatic fire, aggressive movement, and overwhelming force create the chaos needed to survive. You must act faster than the enemy can process, creating sensory overload through multiple inputs — muzzle flash, incoming rounds and rapid movement that breaks their cognitive cycle.

[b]Initiative is everything.[/b] The moment you cede initiative — through hesitation, poor positioning, or predictable movement — you become the victim. Seize it. Keep it. Use it.
[h2]Urban CQC[/h2]

Solo player or not, perfect technique or not, Urban CQC is a toss up between who wins and dies. You can execute movements perfectly and still die, this is the nature of urban CQC. 

As a result, for the solo operator especially - [b]Urban CQC should not be voluntarily engaged in, unless you can be sure you are at an overwhelming advantage.[/b] Given that this is almost never the case, the best advice for your survival is to avoid Urban CQC entirely.

Yes, run away.

Take the random chance of urban CQC out of play by simply falling back, and keeping overwatch of the house you know an enemy is in instead, kill them when they come out to look around. Run out of your urban hide and take an escape route instead of staying to defend it. 

[h3]The Solo Rats Disadvantage[/h3]

Military doctrine almost universally approaches CQC as a team exercise. Standard infantry doctrine trains soldiers to clear rooms, enter buildings and use various different types of grenades as part of a coordinated team. For the solo Rat, these tactics are simply suicidal.

What military doctrine understands is that CQC favours the defender. Even elite level military units consider room clearing to be among the most dangerous operations possible. When military units conduct dynamic entries, they rely on overwhelming force, multiple simultaneous entry points and perfect coordination to overcome the defender's advantage.

There's a reason you see them simply blow the entire building sky high than enter it.

As a solo operator, you possess none of the advantages a team would have clearing a building, you cannot split angles of fire, provide covering fire for yourself, attack from multiple directions or create sufficient enough violence of action.

[h3]When To Enter an Occupied Building Solo[/h3]

Never.

There are no scenarios where a solo Rat should voluntarily enter an occupied building, military doctrine supports this position. In warfare isolated structures with known hostiles are typically contained, the enemy waited out inside, or the entire building is destroyed.

You should never enter a building you [b]know[/b] contains hostiles.

If you suspect a building contains hostiles, assume it does.

If you are already in a building and detect an enemy, extract immediately.

[h3]What If I'm Defending a Building?[/h3]

Get out.

The instinct to defend your position is a trap, defending a fixed position without support, which will always be the case if you are Ratting, is a last resort. 

You will almost always die.

When you choose to stay and defend you go against the principles of Rat doctrine, namely:

[list]
[*]You become predictable.
[*]You limit your escape options.
[*]You allow the enemy to set the terms of engagement.
[*]You become vulnerable to grenades and squad entries.
[*]If they don't enter, they'll just wait for you to leave then kill you.
[/list]

This is why you get out as soon as you can. A dear Rat isn't annoying anyone. Live to be a nuisance elsewhere.

[h3]You're Doing It Anyway?[/h3]

Alright then.

If you are going to engage in urban CQC despite the best of advice from Mr.Ratmeister himself, then fair enough. Despite its obvious disadvantages in terms of longevity of your character, it is fun and exhilarating to roll the dice in CQC.

There are of course, even putting best practices into place, going to be various scenarios when despite best efforts you are forced into urban CQC. Examples include:

[list]
[*]A sniper is decimating your team and holed up in a building you are approaching.
[*]You have entered what you believe to be an empty building only to hear an enemy, your committed now and must deal with the situation.
[*]You're trying to escape and for whatever reason (usually because you are injured and need to heal or you will die) you are cornered in a building and now are forced to defend it.
[*]There's an enemy radio backpack within a building you need to sort out.
[/list]

It would be negligent of me as master Rat then not to show you the best practices on how to survive.

Even military doctrine recognises that urban combat sometimes becomes unavoidable. What applies to conventional forces also applies to you as a lone Rat. The difference is that military units train extensively for these scenarios and operate with team support - luxuries you don't have.

If you must engage in CQC, remember these principles:

[list]
[*]Intelligence gathering comes first - listen for movement and figure out to the best of your ability where in the building they are.
[*]Plan your entry and exit before committing.
[*]When possible, use grenades.
[*]Always pre-fire corners rather than just peeking if there is a chance the enemy is there.
[*]Move decisively - hesitation equals death.
[*]Accept that even perfect execution involves significant risk of extermination.
[/list]

The techniques in the following sections aren't making CQC safe - they're just making it slightly less suicidal. 
[h3]How to Clear Doors[/h3]

Hallways and doors suck. Every doorway is a potential choke point, a bottleneck where defenders enjoy the greatest advantage. This zone is known as the [b]fatal funnel[/b], a narrow area in and immediately beyond the doorway where all incoming movement is focused and where defenders will distinctively aim. You want to be out of the fatal funnel if you can avoid it, depending on the layout of the building and the door itself.

[b]Pre-firing doors[/b] - Bullets penetrate doors and if you know or believe an enemy is or could be behind the door then you absolutely should be pre-firing the door by blasting through it at angles where you think a defender may be hiding. This gives you the element of surprise and there is every chance you kill the defender or force them to have to bandage themselves, giving you the drop.

The Rat must consider every doorway as a know hazard. After pre-firing the door they now have to open it - the picture below advises on the best practice of opening the door:
![url=attachments/DoorClearingTechnique.png]Door Clearing Technique[/url]
Much like real life Arma Reforger allows you to open the door side on as shown in the image, depending on the type of door and the hallway the Rat should immediately step back from the door to give space for them to go on to pie the angles in the room (slicing small sections of the room into view methodically). Ideally when pieing the angles into the room you should be as far away from the door as is possible while still maintaining visual contact within so as to reduce your silhouette to the defender. [b]Do not crouch while doing this, defenders will likely be aiming for your centre mass and crouching lowers your face directly into the sight picture.[/b]

[h3]Slicing the Pie[/h3]

Once the door is opened, you slice the pie by clearing the interior of the room in small segments without entering. The ideal scenario is that the Rat is able to clear the room without entering the fatal funnel or being forced to breach into the room itself. The Rat moves incrementally along the outer arc of the doorway, slowly revealing more of the room slice by slice, as shown below:

![url=attachments/DoorFatalFunnel.png]Door Fatal Funnel[/url]

Each lateral movement reveals a new “slice” of the interior, allowing you to scan corners and engage targets before they see you. This technique gives the you a fighting chance at spotting an enemy who may be holding an angle but hasn't yet seen your approach.

This method is safest when used from a distance not right up against the doorframe. Being too close limits your arc of vision and increases the likelihood of weapon clipping or poor corner geometry revealing your position. Maintain at least one body’s width back from the threshold to keep your weapon in a ready state and ensure maximum field of view.

If the room is shallow, with poor angles or limited cover, and you can confirm it’s clear through slicing do not enter. There is no tactical value in occupying a cleared space that offers no concealment, no advantage, and puts you at risk.

However, if your pie reveals nothing and corners remain unclear, because of doors that open inward for example, or you visually confirm a threat you have been unable to engage you must either:
[list]
[*]Pre-fire and breach using overwhelming violence of action.
[*]Withdraw and reassess your approach.
[/list]

Never, ever 'creep' the final corner, never lean slowly into an uncleared space. Never do any of this slowly or at a pace where a waiting defender can easily adjust their aim to take you out.

You are either clearing or you are breaching. Hesitation will get you killed.

Slicing the pie is your first port of call to clear a room, use it to avoid having to engage in CQC if possible, but once the door is open, you are on the clock. Every second you spend standing in the funnel increases your already exceedingly high risk of death.
[h3]Room Entry[/h3]

Most tactical literature assumes that more than one person is clearing rooms. With two or more Rats, angles can be split, sectors controlled and breaches covered. The Rat however more often than not will be on their own. This means every room entry is a gamble as you expose your body to a potential ambush with no backup to cover your flanks. Breaching a room solo is the most dangerous action you can take in CQC and it should only happen after slicing the pie has revealed a significant portion of the interior.

Room entry begins where slicing ends; when you've cleared every slice of the pie you can from the outside and you now need to breach to clear any remaining blind spots. This is usually the space behind the door, deep corners or anywhere line of sight was occluded dependent on the layout of the room.

The doorway itself, the fatal funnel as we mentioned above, is the killzone where [b]you[/b] die. It is where the defenders are most likely aiming. The longer you are there the higher your chance of death, once you commit to a room breach, you must move immediately, quickly and decisively.

![url=attachments/DoorEntry.png]Door Entry[/url]

As the image shows, the Rat selects an entry vector that aggressively slices away from the most likely threat position. This usually means entering at an oblique angle sweeping wide away from the doorframe while aiming into the uncleared corner. Doors that open into the room you are clearing may have enemies hiding behind them. If you've sliced the rest of the room this is usually the final blind spot and it is where you must go first.

Once inside, pivot rapidly to cover the angles as you move. Do not stop inside the room unless it is clear, motion is a potent defence in these situations. Hesitation and delay gives a waiting defender time to correct their aim.

Once a room is clear, get out and do the next one.
[h3]Hallways[/h3]

A hallway is simply a very large fatal funnel. Never stand in the middle of it, as this exposes you to fire from multiple angles. Cling to the walls where the doors are located to minimize your silhouette and exposure.

When moving through hallways, be conscious of every doorway and opening that could conceal an enemy. Each door you pass represents a potential ambush point, and each meter of hallway traveled increases your risk of detection.

Military CQB training emphasizes proper hallway movement techniques for a reason - they're among the most dangerous environments in urban combat. If forced to move through a hallway:

[list]
[*]Clear each section of hallway before advancing.
[*]Keep your back to the wall you're following.
[*]Minimize time spent in intersections and T-junctions.
[/list]

[h3]Clearing Stairs[/h3]

Stairs also suck, a lot. Stairs, much like the rest of CQC movement are incredibly dangerous places for the Rat to find themselves if a defender is possibly within the building and potentially defending the staircase. They are vertical funnels with zero cover, limited movement options and any movement up or down them is incredibly predictable.

![url=attachments/StairClear.png]Stair Clear[/url]

In squad doctrine staircases are handled with mini bounding overwatch movements and splitting angles. For the solo Rat however none of that exists. You either creep up slowly as most players do and get blasted the second your helmet enters the frame, or you rush.

The correct approach is to pie the base of the stairs first, for any persons stood on the first landing if there is one and then [b]rush[/b]. Violence of action on defended stairs is a necessity and is your only chance out of your already slim chances of survival, I reiterate that if at all possible you should avoid having to clear an occupied building.

You rush stairs because defenders are likely holding an angle that will have your head their sights when you approach, the defender is relying on your slowly creeping up so they can shoot the Rat in the face. Do the opposite instead and rush them.

By rushing them you disrupt their sight picture, break their OODA loop and will force them to adjust their aim as you barrel towards them. It is during this reactionary gap that you kill or be killed.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]

Once you have cleared a building, especially if you have had contact inside, you need to get out. The moment you fire shots in there, even if you kill the enemy, their buddies know where you are and are seeking vengeance. You need to loot quickly, exit immediately and ideally through a different exit to where you entered.
