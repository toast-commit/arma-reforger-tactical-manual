[h1]5. CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT (CQC)[/h1]


CQC represents the most volatile, unforgiving and lethal form of engagement available to the Rat, or any soldier for that matter. CQC is not restricted to buildings. An enemy rushing your bush position creates CQC conditions. A surprise contact in dense vegetation becomes CQC. Any engagement where reaction time shrinks to milliseconds qualifies as close quarters combat. The principles below apply whenever combat distance collapses, regardless of terrain.

In real-world doctrine, CQC is universally recognised as high-risk. In Arma Reforger, it becomes exponentially more dangerous due to client/server latency and occasionally de-sync.

It is for these reasons that the Rat lives by the adage of only engaging when they know they are at an overwhelming advantage. Consciously entering CQC should only be done deliberately if you know, [i]beyond all doubt[/i], that you are in a position of such strong advantage the enemy has almost no chance to survive.

You attack by surprise, you attack with overwhelming force. It is in these moments when the Rat is faced with entering CQC, either because they choose to unleash it on the enemy or because it is unleashed on them, that the Rat must abandon hesitation and commit to the doctrine of [b]overwhelming violence of action[/b].
[h3]Violence of Action[/h3]

Violence of action is key to winning almost any engagement. While stealth, evasion, and deception are the default tools of survival and getting you [i]to[/i] the fight, there comes a moment when the Rat must have the fight itself. When that moment arrives, it must be executed ideally on your terms with [b]overwhelming force, speed, and decisiveness.[/b] 

[b]Violence of action[/b] is the sudden application of surprise, aggression, and dominance to seize the initiative and eliminate the enemy before they can react. It is not optional. It is not negotiable. [b]Hesitation equals death in CQC engagements.[/b]

In Close Quarters Combat, victory usually belongs to whoever strikes first with decisive force. The terms “attacker” and “defender” become meaningless — only initiative matters. A defender caught by surprise dies just as quickly as an attacker walking into an ambush. Position means nothing if you don't see it coming.

CQC is usually won at the moment of first contact. The player who achieves tactical surprise — who gets “the drop” — almost always wins. This advantage can shift in milliseconds. A camping player loses all defensive benefits the moment an enemy appears from an unexpected angle. An aggressive rusher becomes the victim when walking into a pre-aimed weapon. Yet paradoxically the defender holding an angle becomes the victim when the attacker moves faster than they can keep up with and misses their initial shot.

The OODA loop — Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — governs every combat engagement. In CQC, both players race through this cycle in fractions of a second, but the one who completes it first gains the advantage. More critically, the player who disrupts their enemy's OODA loop while completing their own wins the fight.

Violence of action weaponises this principle. When you strike with speed and aggression, you force the enemy to restart their OODA loop. They observe your attack, must reorient to your unexpected aggression, struggle to decide under pressure, and act too late. By the time they complete their cycle, you're already into your second or third loop — adjusting fire, moving to better position, or finishing the kill.

Have you ever been rushed when holding an angle in a building, missed all your shots as the attacker bore down on you and killed you while you struggled to even readjust your aim? That is violence of action in play.

This is why hesitation kills in CQC. Every pause extends your OODA loop. Every moment of indecision gives the enemy time to complete theirs. The Rat who acts decisively — even if imperfectly — forces the enemy into a reactive state they cannot escape.

When CQC is initiated, whether by choice or circumstance, commit fully. Half-measures guarantee failure. Full automatic fire, aggressive movement, and overwhelming force create the chaos needed to survive. You must act faster than the enemy can process, creating sensory overload through multiple inputs — muzzle flash, incoming rounds and rapid movement that breaks their cognitive cycle.

[b]Initiative is everything.[/b] The moment you cede initiative — through hesitation, poor positioning, or predictable movement — you become the victim. Seize it. Keep it. Use it.

Violence of action is not recklessness — it is calculated overwhelming force applied at the moment of contact to establish and maintain initiative. Master the OODA loop and you master CQC. Compress your cycle through violence of action, and expand the enemy's as a result.

[h3]How to Clear Doors[/h3]

Clearing a door is one of the most dangerous actions a Rat can take in CQC. Every doorway is a potential choke point, a bottleneck where defenders enjoy the greatest advantage. This zone is known as the fatal funnel, a narrow area in and immediately beyond the doorway where all incoming movement is focused and where defenders will distinctively aim.

The Rat must consider every doorway as a know hazard. After pre-firing the door they now have to open it - the picture below advises on the best practice of opening the door:
![url=attachments/DoorClearingTechnique.png]Door Clearing Technique[/url]
Much like real life Arma Reforger allows you to open the door side on as shown in the image, depending on the type of door and the hallway the Rat should immediately step back from the door to give space for them to go on to pie the angles in the room. Ideally when pieing the angles into the room you should be as far away from the door as is possible while still maintaining visual contact within so as to reduce your silhouette to the defender. [b]Do not crouch while doing this, defenders will likely be aiming for your centre mass and crouching lowers your face directly into the sight picture.[/b]

[h3]Slicing the Pie[/h3]
Once the door is opened, you slice the pie by clearing the interior of the room in small segments without entering. The ideal scenario is that the Rat is able to clear the room without entering the fatal funnel or being forced to breach into the room itself. The Rat moves incrementally along the outer arc of the doorway, slowly revealing more of the room slice by slice, as shown below:
![url=attachments/DoorFatalFunnel.png]Door Fatal Funnel[/url]
Each lateral movement reveals a new “slice” of the interior, allowing you to scan corners and engage targets before they see you. This technique gives the Rat a fighting chance at spotting an enemy who may be holding an angle but hasn't yet seen your approach.

This method is safest when used from a distance not right up against the doorframe. Being too close limits your arc of vision and increases the likelihood of weapon clipping or poor corner geometry revealing your position. Maintain at least one body’s width back from the threshold to keep your weapon in a ready state and ensure maximum field of view.

If the room is shallow, with poor angles or limited cover, and you can confirm it’s clear through slicing do not enter. There is no tactical value in occupying a cleared space that offers no concealment, no advantage, and puts you at risk.

However, if your pie reveals nothing and corners remain unclear, because of doors that open inward for example, or you visually confirm a threat you have been unable to engage you must either:
[list]
[*]Pre-fire and breach using overwhelming violence of action.
[*]Withdrawn and reassess your approach.
[/list]

Never, ever 'creep' the final corner, never lean slowly into an uncleared space. 

You are either clearing or you are breaching. Hesitation will get you killed.

Slicing the pie is your first port of call to clear a room, use it to avoid having to engage in CWC if possible, but once the door is open, you are on the clock. Every second you spend standing in the funnel increases your already exceedingly high risk of death.
[h3]Room Entry[/h3]
Most tactical literature assumes that more than one person is clearing rooms. With two or more Rats, angles can be split, sectors controlled and breaches covered. The Rat however more often than not will be on their own. This means every room entry is a gamble as you expose your body to a potential ambush with no backup to cover your flanks. Breaching a room solo is the most dangerous action you can take in CQC and it should only happen after slicing the pie has revealed a significant portion of the interior.

Room entry begins where slicing ends; when you've cleared every slice of the pie you can from the outside and you now need to breach to clear any remaining blind spots. This is usually the space behind the door, deep corners or anywhere line of sight was occluded dependent on the layout of the room.

The doorway itself, the fatal funnel as we mentioned above, is the killzone where [b]you[/b] die. It is where the defenders are most likely aiming. The longer you are there the higher your chance of death, once you commit to a room breach, you must move immediately, quickly and decisively.
![url=attachments/DoorEntry.png]Door Entry[/url]
As the image shows, the Rat selects an entry vector that aggressively slices away from the most likely threat position. This usually means entering at an oblique angle sweeping wide away from the doorframe while aiming into the uncleared corner. Doors that open into the room you are clearing may have enemies hiding behind them. If you've sliced the rest of the room this is usually the final blind spot and it is where you must go first.

Once inside, pivot rapidly to cover the angles as you move. Do not stop inside the room unless it is clear, motion is a potent defence in these situations. Hesitation and delay gives a waiting defender time to correct their aim.

Once a room is clear, get out and do the next one.
[h3]Clearing Stairs[/h3]

Stairs, much like the rest of CQC movement are incredibly dangerous places for the Rat to find themselves if a defender is possibly within the building and potentially defending the staircase. They are vertical funnels with zero cover, limited movement options and any movement up or down them is incredibly predictable.
![url=attachments/StairClear.png]Stair Clear[/url]
In squad doctrine staircases are handled with mini bounding overwatch movements and splitting angles. For the solo Rat however none of that exists. You either creep up slowly as most players do and get blasted the second your helmet enters the frame, or you rush.

The correct approach is to pie the base of the stairs first, for any persons stood on the first landing if there is one and then [b]rush[/b]. Violence of action on defended stairs is a necessity and is your only chance out of your already slim chances of survival, I reiterate that if at all possible you should avoid having to clear an occupied building.

You rush stairs because defenders are likely holding an angle that will have your head in it the moment you approach, the defender is relying on your slowly creeping up so they can shoot the Rat in the face. Do the opposite instead and rush them.

By rushing them you disrupt their sight picture, break their rhythm and will force them to adjust their aim as you barrel towards them. It is during this reactionary gap that you kill or be killed.

[h3]Hallways[/h3]
A hallway is simply a very large fatal funnel, never stand in the middle of it, cling to the walls the doors are on, and try and avoid the angles from which you could be sprayed through a door as you pass through the hallways as much as you can.
