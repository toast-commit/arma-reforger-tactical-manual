[h1]III. Weapons & Fire Control[/h1]


[h3]Aim Point[/h3]
Short-range engagements fall into two categories based on your mission and the level of threat:

[b]Incapacitating Shot placement[/b] - The lethal zone of the target is the centre mass between the waist and the chest, shots here maximise the chance of both accuracy and that your target will be eliminated. In dynamic firefights this is the best shot placement for accuracy and efficacy.

[b]Lethal Shot Placement[/b] - The only short placement that guarantees immediate and total incapacitation is one roughly centred on the face. Shots to the side of the head should be centred between the crown of the skull and the middle of the ear opening. Shots to the helmet in Reforger do not guarantee incapacitation. If you're looking to end the fight before it begins, aim for the face below the helmet.
[h3]Trigger Manipulation[/h3]
Due to reduced reduced reaction time, poor sight picture, body armour and server lag you are required to effectively place rounds into threat targets. You must fire multiple rounds during each engagement in order to survive. Multiple shots may be fired using the controlled pair, automatic fire and the failure drill.

[b]Controlled pair[/b] - First two rounds in rapid succession, when you fire the first, let the shot move the weapon in its natural arc and do not fight the recoil. Rapidly bring the weapon back on target and fire the second round. Fire controlled pairs at an individual target until he goes down. When you have multiple targets, fire a controlled pair at each target, then reengage any targets left standing. 

This method works because the delay between your shots while you adjust the weapon allows for more accurate, deliberate shot placement.

[b]Automatic or Burst Fire[/b] - You might need to maximise the violence of action or when you need fire superiority to gain a foothold in a room, building or ambush. You should be able to fire six rounds (two three round bursts) in the same time it takes to fire a controlled pair. The accuracy of engaging targets can be equal to that of semiautomatic fire at around 10 meters.

[b]Failure Drill[/b] - To make sure a target is completely neutralised in Reforger, you will need to execute the failure drill. Fire a controlled pair at the lethal zone of the target (body), and then fire a single shot to the incapacitating zone (head). If you can be certain of your accuracy, one shot to the incapacitating zone will work.
[h3]Trigger Discipline[/h3]
The vast majority of players will shoot the moment they have a shot. Rats do not.

Trigger discipline is the conscious decision to delay an engagement until the conditions favour you. It is the difference between reaction and control.

Your first opportunity to fire is often not your best one. You may have only a partial sight picture. The target may be outside your effective range. Your weapon sway may be too heavy after a sprint. Their movement may be erratic, or their positioning unfavourable for follow-up shots. And critically â€” you may not yet know if they are alone.

Firing your weapon sets in motion a chain of events from which there is no return. A single shot alerts the area. A second confirms your position. Within 60 seconds, the enemy will either be returning fire or closing ground to flank you. Rats do not engage unless they are ready to move.

Ask yourself - Can I drop the target cleanly with my first volley? Is my exfiltration route already planned? Will this engagement serve a broader tactical purpose?

If the answer to any of these is no, hold fire.
