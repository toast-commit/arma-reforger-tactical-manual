[h1]IV. Engagement Tactics[/h1]

[h3]Dead Time Exploitation[/h3]

Most kills in Arma Reforger happen during direct engagements but Rats do not seek fair fights. Ratting doctrine prioritises attacking from a position of overwhelming advantage. One of the most reliable ways to achieve that advantage is to exploit what is known as dead time.

Dead time is any moment when an enemy’s awareness is reduced when they are standing still, focused on a task, or otherwise distracted. Common examples include:

[list]
[*]Checking the map after spawning or getting into a vehicle
[*]Looting or purchasing gear
[*]Reloading
[*]Sitting idle in a vehicle waiting for passengers
[*]Holding defensive positions inside buildings or behind cover (camping)
[*]Pausing in spawn areas or immediately after leaving base
[/list]

The most predictable of these behaviours is looting gear from bodies or purchasing from an arsenal.

Dead time provides the opportunity to fire at a completely stationary, preoccupied target. A single well-placed shot in this moment is more effective than three fired at a moving or alert target. The delay in the enemy’s reaction also extends your survivability affording you precious seconds to relocate or prepare follow-up shots before they identify your position.

You will begin to recognise that dead time forms behavioural patterns. Players spawn, then move to the arsenal. They spawn vehicles, then sit to check the map. After battles, they return to loot gear.

Your job as a Rat is to observe these rhythms and exploit them. You must time your engagement so that you strike when the enemy is least capable of responding and disappear before they recover.

Predictive ambush is the deliberate act of positioning based not on the enemy’s current location, but on a clear understanding of what they are likely to do next. It is a proactive form of engagement planning based on behaviour, timing, and terrain.

When dead time begins, the Rat engages with precision. If the shot is placed correctly, the engagement ends before the enemy can react. If the shot fails, the responsibility lies with entirely with the Rat.
[h3]Body Baiting[/h3]

Body baiting is the deliberate use of casualties or wounded players to lure others into a compromised position. It is a psychological and tactical trap that is a strand of predictive ambush. 

Rats may initiate this tactic in one of two ways: by injuring or killing a target while already holding overwatch on the position, or by moving into overwatch after noticing a casualty in an ideal position. In either case, the objective remains the same - force the enemy to expose themselves.

Players in FPS games that allow looting struggle to resist the impulse to retrieve loot or assist injured teammates. Most will move toward a fallen comrade or enemy body without first assessing the situation and as a result put themselves into a position of huge vulnerability. Once a player begins looting, they are immobile and all it takes is a well placed shot to prevent any sort of direct confrontation in the first place.

Body baiting punishes greed, loyalty and carelessness in equal measure. Use it when terrain and concealment favour your position and when there is a high likelihood of multiple contacts entering the kill zone.
[h3]Ambush[/h3]

An ambush is a surprise attack delivered from concealment or cover. For the Rat, it is not a platoon-level fire plan but a solo strike: sharp, brutal, and brief, over almost as soon as it begins.

Because Rats operate alone, every ambush demands some foresight and discipline. Before firing a single round, the Rat must select and reconnoitre a kill zone, choose a concealed vantage with clear sight of that zone and a pre-planned escape route, and rehearse the sequence in their mind: engage, finish the strike, vanish. The moment the Rat is seen or heard, the ambush ends and escape begins.

The ambush has the following objectives:

[b]Eliminate.[/b] The primary objective is a clean kill that removes enemy combat power and denies them the chance to react.

[b]Strand.[/b] If elimination fails, the secondary goal is to disable or immobilise the enemy. Force them to dismount, walk, or burn a respawn ticket. Time lost to recovery or to have to stay and heal, delaying their onward mission, is a tactical victory.

[b]Frustrate.[/b] If neither kill nor stranding is possible, the tertiary objective is to sow doubt. A single wounding shot or forced delay burdens the enemy with caution and slows their mission as they spend time searching for you.

Before committing to an ambush, the Rat must assess whether the action will influence the match as a whole. A perfect firing position is useless if the only targets are isolated players. Conversely, an ambush laid on a key reinforcement route or an exit of a key base can decisively alter momentum in the team's favour.

Always ask: [i]Will this make a difference?[/i] If the answer is no, find another mission.

Planning an ambush requires two critical elements: a kill zone and a vantage point. The kill zone is the area through which the enemy must pass and where fire will be concentrated. An ideal kill zone is long enough to allow for multiple shots, follow-up fire, reloading, or weapon switching if necessary. Narrow kill zones demanding a single perfect shot are unacceptable.

Contingencies must be considered. A wounded driver may stop; a dead driver may crash the vehicle. The vantage point must allow continued engagement during such events without exposing the Rat to return fire.

If the kill zone or vantage point is suboptimal, the ambush must be abandoned. No Rat should gamble their life unless the odds are overwhelmingly in their favour. Proper ambush sites create conditions where enemy survival is unlikely and pursuit is impossible.

Impulse kills opportunity. It is tempting to fire at any movement, but a disciplined Rat exercises patience. If ammunition is limited, conserve it. Allow lone vehicles or isolated enemies to pass. Prioritise high-value targets — troop transports, supply trucks, armoured vehicles or entire squads walking through. A single RPG round is a precious asset; it should never be wasted on a kill that changes nothing.

Engage only when the primary target is inside the designated kill zone. Temptation to fire early must be resisted. Waiting until the enemy enters the kill zone maximises your tactical advantage and improves the likelihood of a clean kill.

Maintain fire until the enemy is neutralised, stranded, or suppressed. The litmus test for disengagement is simple: if the enemy begins returning effective fire towards your position, you must withdraw. The moment rounds strike near your cover, the ambush has served its purpose. Remaining in place only increases the chance of being overrun.

Unless the engagement has reduced to a clear one-on-one or a severely disadvantaged enemy position, break contact immediately. Move to secondary cover and begin evasion. Continued engagement is justified only if the enemy remains stranded, confused, and unaware of your new location.

A Rat who plans, strikes, and escapes with precision eliminates resources, drains time, and frustrates the enemy team's efforts to win the game.
[h3]False Retreat[/h3]

A natural extension of the ambush — and a key tactic in the Rat’s arsenal — is the [b]false retreat[/b]. Rats will find themselves using this technique in almost every operation they undertake.

The false retreat mirrors elements of conventional infantry contact-break drills, but the term is better suited to the solo operator. Where conventional forces withdraw under pressure, the Rat withdraws deliberately — baiting the enemy into yet another engagement where the Rat holds the advantage.

In a false retreat, the Rat falls back from their original vantage point after firing, then establishes a secondary position with clear oversight of the site just abandoned. Understanding the impulsive nature of players in FPS environments — where wounded or angered enemies will rush forward seeking revenge — the Rat turns enemy aggression into a trap. As the enemy pushes into the original kill zone, the Rat, now concealed in a new overwatch position, engages them once again from surprise.

The false retreat grants the Rat a second opportunity to eliminate targets who survived the initial strike. Pursuers are often disorganised, wounded, or overconfident — all advantages to the Rat lying in wait.

When conducting a false retreat, the fallback position must offer concealment, overwatch of your recent vantage point which now becomes your new kill zone, and impose fresh disadvantages upon the enemy. The same principles apply as in the original ambush. If the enemy gains sight of your fallback position and begins delivering sustained, accurate fire, you must immediately disengage. A Rat does not hold ground against superior firepower.

False retreats will often be dynamic and fluid. Some situations will not allow the Rat to properly assess the viability of the fallback position until after reaching it. Once in place, the Rat must pause and reconsider: [i]If the enemy appears within the new kill zone, what are my rules of engagement?[/i]

Often the second position will not be as strong as the first. If your new position is weak, maintain overwatch at distance. Be patient. Many enemies will eventually return to the scene of the original ambush to retrieve wounded comrades, to recover supplies, or simply to resume their mission. When they do, the Rat repeats the ambush process. Strike again. Kill again. It is also an option to do nothing and wait for them to leave, believing you have either given up or died, before setting up your original ambush on the next party coming through.

The enemy must never feel safe — not after the first shot, not after the pursuit, not after the supposed retreat.
[h3]Shoot and Scoot[/h3]

As stated in the foreword, most published infantry doctrine focuses on team-based tactics. When you're part of a fire team or squad, you have access to a wide array of techniques involving suppression, bounding overwatch, and coordinated manoeuvre. Solo operators do not have that luxury. And if real-world doctrine exists for lone soldiers acting as Rats, it isn’t publicly available.

So we adapt.

[b]Shoot and scoot[/b] is a concept borrowed from artillery doctrine: fire, displace, do not wait to assess results. For artillery, this prevents counter-battery fire. For the Rat, it prevents death.

This is not an ambush. There is no intent to hold ground, confirm kills, or re-engage from the same position. You fire — ideally at an exposed target — then immediately relocate. Whether you kill, wound, or miss entirely is secondary. The goal is disruption.

This tactic is ideal in several scenarios. First, when you do not hold a strong positional advantage and cannot risk taking return fire. Firing from a poor position and staying there is suicide. Firing and moving forces the enemy to respond while you are already gone.

Second, it is especially effective when the intent is not elimination but confusion. Surprise fire from an unexpected direction forces squads to halt, reorganise, or retreat. Even one well-timed shot can derail their momentum and focus attention away from the objective.

Third, shoot and scoot is one of the most viable solo tactics against armoured vehicles. A lone Rat cannot face armour in a stand-up fight. Even with an RPG, engaging once from cover may reveal your position. Scooting to a new angle and firing again keeps the vehicle off-balance, unsure of where the next shot will come from. Never engage armour from the same position twice.

Use shoot and scoot to apply pressure while remaining survivable. Fire, displace, reset. The enemy will be watching your last known position while you’re already preparing the next shot. That delay is your advantage. Maintain initiative. Control the tempo. Stay mobile, and stay alive.
